## Install

=== "macOS / Linux"

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://roborev.io/install.sh | bash
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://roborev.io/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

=== "Go"

    ```bash
    go install go.kenn.io/roborev/cmd/roborev@latest
    ```

    Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH.

!!! tip "Let your agent do it"

    Prefer to have your coding agent handle setup? Give it the
    [Agent-Assisted Setup](/docs/agent-setup/) prompt.

## Set Up Your Repo

```bash
cd your-repo
roborev init
```

This installs a post-commit hook and starts the roborev daemon. From now on,
every commit in this repo is automatically reviewed by an AI agent in the
background.

!!! note

    Hook installation automatically detects your git hook manager (Husky, etc.) via
    `core.hooksPath`.

## Open the TUI

After a few commits, open the terminal UI to see your reviews:

```bash
roborev tui
```

<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>
  <img src="/docs/assets/generated/tui-queue.svg" alt="roborev TUI queue view" loading="lazy">
</figure>

The review queue is a ledger of every review roborev has run. Each entry stays
open until you explicitly close it, so you always know which agent-generated
code has been reviewed and which findings still need attention.

Press `Enter` on any job to read the full review. Use `j`/`k` or arrow keys to
navigate. Press `?` for all available shortcuts.

## Working with Reviews

### Copy and paste into your agent

The fastest way to act on a review is to copy it and paste it into your coding
agent session. Press `y` on any completed review to copy its content to your
clipboard.

<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>
  <img src="/docs/assets/generated/tui-copy.svg" alt="Copying a review to clipboard" loading="lazy">
</figure>

Paste the review into Claude Code, Codex, or whichever agent you're working
with. The agent sees the full findings and can address them directly. Once
you've handled the feedback, press `a` in the TUI to mark the review as closed.

### Use the `/roborev-fix` skill

If you use Claude Code or Codex, install the roborev agent skills:

```bash
roborev skills install
```

Then from your agent session, run the fix skill to discover and address all open
review findings in one pass:

```
/roborev-fix          # Claude Code
$roborev-fix          # Codex
```

The agent fetches your open reviews, groups findings by file, fixes them in
priority order, runs tests, and offers to commit. See
[Agent Skills](/docs/guides/agent-skills/) for the full skill reference.

### Use `roborev fix` from the CLI

For a headless fix without an interactive agent session:

```bash
roborev fix                        # Fix all open reviews on this branch
roborev fix 123                    # Fix a specific review by job ID
roborev fix --plan-only            # Inspect and store plans without edits
roborev fix --plan                 # Plan before applying fixes
```

The agent applies changes, commits, and closes the review. For a fully automated
loop that re-reviews and iterates until everything passes, use `roborev refine`.
