!!! warning "Advanced opt-in feature"

    Background tasks are disabled by default. Enable them from the command line:

    ```bash
    roborev config set advanced.tasks_enabled true --global
    ```

    This feature provides an advanced workflow for running fix jobs and applying
    patches directly from the TUI. Most users should address review findings by
    copying the review (`y`) and pasting it into their coding agent session, or by
    using [`/roborev-fix`](/docs/guides/agent-skills/) or
    [`roborev fix`](/docs/commands/#fixing-reviews).

## Fix Jobs

Press `F` on a completed review to open the inline fix panel at the bottom of
the review view. You can optionally type custom instructions for the fix agent,
or leave it blank for defaults. Press `Enter` to submit, `Esc` to cancel.

While the fix panel is open, `Tab` toggles focus between the review content (for
scrolling) and the fix input. The panel border is magenta when focused and gray
when inactive.

From the queue view, pressing `F` fetches the review and opens the fix panel in
one step.

The fix runs in an isolated git worktree checked out at the reviewed commit (not
HEAD), so the patch is always generated against the correct revision. This
prevents conflicts when the working tree has moved on since the review.

Results appear in the Tasks view (`T`). While the fix runs, you can continue
browsing reviews normally.

## Tasks View

Press `T` from the queue view to switch to the Tasks view, which shows all fix
jobs and their status.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up`/`k`, `Down`/`j` | Navigate tasks |
| `Enter` / `l` | View output (live for running, result for done, error for failed) |
| `p` | View patch diff |
| `A` | Apply patch to working tree |
| `R` | Re-run fix against current HEAD (rebase) |
| `x` | Cancel queued/running job |
| `s` | Save patch to disk |
| `r` | Refresh task list |
| `T` / `Esc` | Return to queue |
| `?` | Toggle help |

The Tasks view also supports mouse interactions: click a task to select it, or
double-click to view its output.

## Applying and Rebasing Patches

Press `A` on a completed fix job to apply the generated patch and commit it to
your working tree. The parent review is automatically closed when the patch is
applied.

If the patch conflicts with the current state of your working tree (e.g. because
new commits landed after the review), roborev offers to re-run the fix against
current HEAD. Press `R` to trigger a rebase: the agent receives the original
patch as context and produces a new patch targeting the current code.
