All notable changes to roborev, grouped by minor release.

## Unreleased

**New features**

- The web UI reports an anonymous `app_opened` event through the daemon when it
    loads and on the first window focus of each later UTC day.
    `ROBOREV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` turns it off with the daemon events. See
    [Telemetry](/docs/configuration/#telemetry).
- `roborev tui` reports an anonymous `app_opened` event through the daemon when
    it starts, and web and TUI events carry `surface` (`web` or `tui`).
    `ROBOREV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` turns it off. See
    [Telemetry](/docs/configuration/#telemetry).
- CLI commands that work through the daemon report an anonymous `app_opened`
    event with `surface: cli` after their first successful daemon request. The
    daemon now sends at most one `app_opened` per surface per UTC day, so
    repeated web, TUI and CLI opens on the same day count once. Commands the
    bundled agent skills run carry `--from-skill` so they are not counted. See
    [Telemetry](/docs/configuration/#telemetry).
- Plan fixes before implementation with `roborev fix --plan` or
    `roborev refine --plan`. Use `--plan-only` to print and store plans without
    editing code. Background fix requests and the TUI fix panel can also plan
    before implementation.

**Improvements**

- Simplify TUI navigation: use `PgUp`/`PgDn` to page through content and `u` to
    open release notes. The `u`/`d` paging and `Ctrl-P`/`Ctrl-N` movement
    aliases are removed. Main views retain `Home`/`g` top jumps; `gg` and
    `End`/`G` aliases are removed. In the log view, `g`/`G` toggles between the
    top and bottom.
- Set `synthesis_reasoning` on a review panel to choose the reasoning level for
    its synthesis step without changing `fix_reasoning`. See
    [panel configuration](/docs/advanced/subagent-review-panels/#panels).

## 0.70.0

<small>2026-09-30</small>

Compare review performance across agents and models, use light mode in the
browser, and search large review histories with less CPU use. Before updating,
check the [0.70.0 upgrade steps](/docs/installation/#upgrading-to-0700) for TUI
filters, search credentials, and Agent Hook reminders.

**New features**

- Compare web analytics by agent, model, project, or source with **Break down
    by**. Choose p50, p90, or p99 for latency, and hide or highlight individual
    chart series. See [Analytics](/docs/web-ui/#analytics).
- Use light mode in the web UI. It follows your system setting by default, and
    the header toggle remembers your preference. See
    [Browser UI](/docs/web-ui/).
- Set up roborev with your coding agent using the
    [agent-assisted setup guide](/docs/agent-setup/). The guide covers hooks,
    skills, and review guidelines, and tells the agent to ask before each
    change.

**Improvements**

- Daemons that sync through PostgreSQL now share review-search vectors. A daemon
    imports vectors another machine already computed for the same review text
    instead of sending that text to its embedding provider again. There is no
    setting. See
    [shared vectors](/docs/search/#shared-vectors-across-synced-machines).
- Open the TUI directly to the current repository and branch, including in
    linked worktrees. Press `Esc` to clear the filters. The settings are now
    `filter_repo` and `filter_branch` under `[tui]`; the old `auto_filter_repo`
    and `auto_filter_branch` keys no longer apply. Set either new key to `false`
    to disable that filter. See
    [TUI filtering](/docs/integrations/tui/#filtering).
- Agent Hook reminders now require project review guidance. Add
    `review_guidelines` in `.roborev.toml` on the default branch, or use
    `REVIEW.md` when that setting is unset. Global guidelines alone do not
    enable reminders. See
    [the guidance requirement](/docs/agent-hook/#review-guidelines-are-required).
- Configure semantic search, which finds reviews by meaning, with a key string,
    an environment variable, or a private key file. Under `[search.embeddings]`,
    replace `api_key_env = "NAME"` with `api_key = { env = "NAME" }`. Local
    servers can receive requests without authentication when no key is
    configured. Existing embeddings are kept. See
    [search credentials](/docs/search/#embedding-credentials).
- Search uses less CPU on large review histories. Review events update only
    affected reviews, and embedding backfill avoids repeated scans of unchanged
    history. See [search freshness](/docs/search/#freshness-and-backfill).
- Review instructions require evidence for findings, check dependency behavior
    against pinned versions, and match severity to plausible triggers. They also
    tell reviewers to respect prior developer responses unless a code change
    invalidates them.
- See more reviews at once in the web table. Each row shows the model beside the
    agent, and the commit cell includes the repository, branch, ref, and
    subject. See [Reviews Workspace](/docs/web-ui/#reviews-workspace).
- Read GitHub review comments with less repetition. Reviewers appear once in the
    footer, and each finding separates the problem from its suggested fix.
- Follow slow daemon starts without opening the logs yourself. Start and restart
    allow up to two minutes for readiness and report progress every 15 seconds,
    including the startup log path and latest message. See
    [daemon startup](/docs/configuration/#persistent-daemon).

**Bug fixes**

- Sort any column in the web review table without loading the entire history.
    Sorting applies to loaded rows; a note identifies when older jobs remain
    unloaded.
- Analytics charts show gaps when failure-rate or latency data is missing
    instead of plotting zero. The unfinished final period is faded or dashed.
- Reviews of fix commits receive instructions to suppress resolved findings and
    avoid asking users to undo fixes made for earlier feedback. Reviewers must
    still report problems that remain or were introduced by a fix.
- Reviews and keyword search continue when configured embedding credentials are
    missing. Status and health explain missing or rejected credentials.
- Deleted reviews no longer appear in search results or affect their scores.
    Reruns refresh the search index immediately.
- CI reviews find older pull requests in repositories with more than 100 open
    PRs. Wildcard discovery skips repositories that explicitly disable pull
    requests.
- CI reviews continue after a branch such as `feature` is replaced by nested
    branches such as `feature/login`. Retries honor skip labels, and cleanup
    retries unfinished work for closed or superseded reviews.
- CI polling and recovery failures mark application health as unhealthy while
    unaffected reviews continue. Recorded retry failures remain visible after
    restart until recovery or removal.
- Health checks respect each active review's configured deadline, including
    repository and panel overrides. Reviews allowed to run longer than 30
    minutes are no longer flagged as stuck at that point.
- `roborev list` and `roborev show` can display reviews whose stored prompts
    contain invalid UTF-8 text. Responses replace malformed bytes without
    changing the stored text.
- PostgreSQL sync accepts review text containing invalid UTF-8 or NUL bytes.
    Existing pending reviews retry automatically.
- `review --branch` uses the detected default branch when a PR-head or
    feature-branch upstream is missing locally. Explicit base settings still
    take precedence; missing trunk upstreams still produce an error. See
    [branch reviews](/docs/guides/reviewing-code/#feature-branches).
- Linked worktrees use their own branch's tracked hooks when `core.hooksPath`
    names a relative directory tracked in Git. See
    [hook maintenance](/docs/guides/repository-management/#git-hook-maintenance).
- Claude Code weekly-limit errors trigger quota handling. Reviews move to a
    configured backup instead of retrying the same agent during cooldown.

## 0.69.0

<small>2026-09-24</small>

**New features**

- `roborev list` shows each review's verdict in a `Verdict` column: `P` for
    pass, `F` for fail, and `-` when no verdict is recorded. See
    [Viewing Reviews](/docs/commands/#viewing-reviews).
- The browser reviews table has a Closed column that shows whether each review
    is open or closed, with `--` when no closed state is available. See
    [Reviews Workspace](/docs/web-ui/#reviews-workspace).

**Bug fixes**

- The review, design-review, lookahead-review, and refine skills accept valid
    Git refs instead of stopping with `fatal: Needed a single revision`. The fix
    covers the branch variants and the Claude, Codex, Droid, and Grok skills.
- Claude Code reviews and design classification work through
    Anthropic-compatible proxies configured with `model@base_url` that omit
    optional tool-call metadata.
- Grok reviews no longer fail on machines where Grok's default sandbox cannot
    start, such as with OrbStack. roborev retries once with Grok's `workspace`
    sandbox, and `[agent.grok] sandbox` lets you choose the profile. See
    [Grok sandbox profile](/docs/agents/#sandbox-profile).
- The daemon keeps processing jobs after an interrupted SQLite transaction
    instead of stalling until restart. This also prevents related
    `roborev status` hangs and post-commit enqueue timeouts.

Thanks to [Rod Boev](https://github.com/rodboev) for list verdicts in
[#1228](https://github.com/kenn-io/roborev/pull/1228) and the browser Closed
column in [#1227](https://github.com/kenn-io/roborev/pull/1227), and to

## 0.68.2

<small>2026-09-22</small>

Migration runs automatically when you start this version. You can upgrade
directly from 0.67.0 or 0.68.0 to 0.68.2 without installing intermediate
versions. If the 0.68.1 migration already completed, there are no reviews left
to migrate. No manual conversion is required to use historical reviews.

**Bug fixes**

- Historical review migration now processes 100 reviews per batch, reducing
    startup memory use when upgrading from 0.68.0. Completed review updates
    survive an interrupted upgrade, and startup logs show migration progress.
    This fixes the migration memory problem in 0.68.1 while preserving review
    content, IDs, and open/closed state. See
    [migration troubleshooting](/docs/guides/troubleshooting/#high-memory-use-during-historical-review-migration).
- An index speeds up archived panel-source lookup during migration. SQLite job
    table copying also uses batches; the table replacement remains atomic.

To optionally convert remaining legacy text into structured findings, follow the
[canonical agent migration guide](https://github.com/kenn-io/roborev/pull/1219#agent-migration-guide).

Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for the
migration batching fix in [#1224](https://github.com/kenn-io/roborev/pull/1224).

## 0.68.1

<small>2026-09-22</small>

This release restores review history affected by the 0.68.0 JSON migration. For
records that still need conversion, follow the
[canonical agent migration guide](https://github.com/kenn-io/roborev/pull/1219#agent-migration-guide).
Start with
[troubleshooting missing or unstructured reviews](/docs/guides/troubleshooting/#missing-or-unstructured-reviews-after-upgrade).

**New features**

- Search completed review history by keyword, repository, branch, time, verdict,
    and open/closed state with `roborev search`. Optional semantic and hybrid
    search use an OpenAI-compatible embedding provider; lexical search works
    without one. See [Review History Search](/docs/search/).

**Improvements**

- Historical reviews return automatically on upgrade, including reviews archived
    by 0.68.0. Recognized Markdown becomes structured findings; other text stays
    readable as a labeled legacy JSON document with its recorded verdict and
    open/closed state. No AI calls are needed. Agents can optionally convert the
    remaining text through the existing `legacy-reviews export/import` workflow
    or the new local `POST /api/review/migrate` endpoint. Imports reject invalid
    documents and never replace an already structured review. See
    [legacy migration](guides/reviewing-code.md#review-storage-and-legacy-migration)
    and the
    [agent conversion procedure](https://github.com/kenn-io/roborev/pull/1219#agent-migration-guide).

- `roborev export reviews` reports whether each review is closed. Every
    top-level review has a `closed` boolean and an `updated_at` timestamp, and
    review export documents now use `schema_version: 2`. The new
    `--updated-since` flag returns reviews that changed after a given time, so
    consumers can pick up reviews closed or reopened after they were first
    exported. See [Exporting Reviews](/docs/commands/#exporting-reviews).

- `roborev export reviews` exports each review as data. In the `content`
    profile, every review and subagent has a `document` field with the stored
    JSON review document: the summary, verdict, and findings. `document` is the
    canonical form, and `content` is still the Markdown rendering of it. Other
    Go modules can import `go.kenn.io/roborev/pkg/structuredreview` to decode
    and render a document. See
    [Exporting Reviews](/docs/commands/#exporting-reviews).

- Filter recorded analyses by type and file with `roborev list --analysis-type`
    and `--file`. See [Viewing Reviews](/docs/commands/#viewing-reviews).

**Bug fixes**

- Legacy review text remains available in search and comments instead of
    appearing empty or as "No issues found." Exports include legacy reviews with
    an unknown verdict, and generated Go clients preserve the required JSON null
    value when serializing those documents.
- SQLite job IDs are no longer reused after deletion. Removing a repository with
    its jobs also removes their archived reviews.
- Agent Hook continuation reminders retain the original review IDs, including
    across daemon restarts. Newly queued reviews do not expand an active fix
    session. Bundled skills explain how to update the selected binary, daemon,
    hook registration, and installed skills. See
    [Agent Hook](/docs/agent-hook/).

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [salmonumbrella](https://github.com/salmonumbrella) for review
    history search, [Rod Boev](https://github.com/rodboev) for analysis metadata
    and filters, and [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for release checks
    and documentation improvements.

## 0.68.0

<small>2026-09-20</small>

Before updating, check the
[0.68.0 upgrade instructions](/docs/installation/#upgrading-to-0680).

**New features**

- Define custom review types in `.roborev.toml` or global configuration, with
    reusable templates, included files, and agent, model, or reasoning settings.
    Custom types support Codex, Claude Code, Pi, and Grok. See
    [Custom Review Types](/docs/advanced/custom-review-types/).
- Connect coding agents through the optional Model Context Protocol server with
    `roborev mcp serve` or the daemon's HTTP endpoint. MCP tools read reviews
    and record comments, closures, snoozes, and completed hook fix sessions.
    Review creation stays on the CLI. See [MCP Server](/docs/integrations/mcp/).
- Configure MCP with `roborev mcp install`, or select it for skills and Agent
    Hooks with `--mcp`. Installation supports Claude Code, Codex, Factory Droid,
    Grok Build, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Hermes, and Qwen. CLI mode remains the
    default. See
    [MCP installation](/docs/integrations/mcp/#install-for-coding-agents).
- Trial a reviewer without affecting the result by setting `non_voting = true`
    on a panel member. Panels combine multiple reviewers into one review.
    Non-voting reviews remain available to read, but do not affect or delay the
    combined verdict, PR comment, or CI status. See
    [Subagent Review Panels](/docs/advanced/subagent-review-panels/#subagents).
- Choose review models and reasoning effort per project from global
    configuration, matched by Git remote. Separate settings control the combined
    panel review, and optional overrides replace settings pinned to panel
    members. See
    [Project Defaults by Git Remote](/docs/configuration/#project-defaults-by-git-remote).
- Skip automatic post-commit reviews for branch families with
    `excluded_branch_patterns` in `.roborev.toml`, such as `worktree-agent-*`.
    See [Excluded Branches](/docs/configuration/#excluded-branches).
- Rerun a completed or failed ordinary job with another agent by pressing `R` in
    the terminal interface. The rerun uses that agent's defaults and replaces
    the previous review. Lowercase `r` keeps the existing rerun behavior. See
    [Terminal queue](/docs/integrations/tui/#queue-view).
- See reviewed and excluded file counts for committed and range reviews in
    `roborev show`, terminal review details, and the review API. See
    [Viewing Reviews](/docs/commands/#viewing-reviews).
- Read recent release notes before updating. Press `u` in the terminal interface
    or open them from the web application header.
- List jobs across every branch in the current repository with
    `roborev list --all-branches`.
- Copy review Markdown with the new copy button in the web review view. See
    [Browser review workspace](/docs/web-ui/#reviews-workspace).

**Improvements**

- Reviews retain findings below `review_min_severity` or `--min-severity`. The
    threshold determines pass or fail without removing lower-severity findings
    from the stored review. Passing reviews do not trigger fixes. They close
    automatically when `auto_close_passing_reviews` is enabled. GitHub comments
    show only findings at or above the threshold. See
    [Severity Filtering](/docs/guides/reviewing-code/#severity-filtering).
- Codex, Claude Code, Pi, and Grok return structured findings for all review
    types. Combined panel reviews identify which reviewers reported each
    finding. Pi reviews now require the `pi-json-schema` extension. See
    [Pi Structured Output](/docs/agents/#pi-structured-output).
- Review history stores and syncs validated JSON, with Markdown generated for
    display and export. During upgrade, reviews that cannot be converted
    faithfully move to an archive and disappear from normal review views. Use
    `roborev legacy-reviews export` and `import` to convert and restore them.
    See
    [Legacy review migration](/docs/guides/reviewing-code/#review-storage-and-legacy-migration).
- Compare reviews directly in the queue. Both interfaces show review types,
    while the terminal queue also shows recorded reasoning effort and finding
    severity counts.
- Large reviews retain complete prompts, findings, discussion, and diagnostics
    without the former fixed cutoffs. Prompts above the inline budget move to a
    file the reviewer reads. Model context limits, configured policies, and
    provider comment limits still apply. See
    [Large Diffs](/docs/guides/reviewing-code/#large-diffs).
- Follow-up branch reviews receive earlier reviews and responses as optional
    context when the branch keeps the same base.
- CI queues load faster with large review histories, and upgrades from before
    0.67.0 avoid repeated history scans during daemon startup. The web
    application also begins loading reviews sooner.
- CLI JSON and MCP job listings and review results include `web_url` when the
    daemon has an active browser listener. See
    [Review links](/docs/integrations/mcp/#review-links).
- Codex and Droid review sessions carry a `roborev` label in their session
    metadata or logs. Older Codex versions keep their existing invocation.
- AgentsView usage lookup prefers archived usage, including subagents, without
    synchronizing source transcripts when supported. Older versions retain token
    reporting through fallback commands.
- CI review processes no longer inherit publishing credentials or Git credential
    helpers. Regenerate existing CI configurations to adopt the changes. Copilot
    requires a separate `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` with Copilot Requests permission.
    See
    [Generated CI workflows](/docs/integrations/github/#how-the-generated-workflow-works).
- Obsolete Agent Hook registrations now require manual removal before
    reinstalling. If an outdated hook reports an error, remove its command from
    the agent configuration and run `roborev agent-hook install`. See
    [Agent Hook runtime](/docs/agent-hook/#runtime-model).
- Roborev no longer provides Nix flake packaging.
- Fix agents check Git history when asked to restore or revert behavior,
    preserving established names and migration definitions when compatible with
    current requirements. See
    [Responding to Reviews](/docs/guides/responding-to-reviews/#auto-fix-with-roborev-fix).

**Bug fixes**

- Reviews that report an unreadable diff no longer count as reviews that found
    problems. They fail over to a configured backup or finish with a
    `no-verdict` error. Panels with no usable reviewer output finish as errors
    without posting PR comments.
- CI reviewers and combined panel reviews use their configured backup agent and
    model when the primary reaches a quota, session limit, or cooldown.
- Git hook repair reads registered repositories without running migrations, so
    it can proceed while the daemon holds a database write lock.
- GitHub Enterprise Server authentication uses the configured Enterprise API for
    GitHub App token exchange and repository operations. Set `ci.github_api_url`
    to `https://HOST/api/v3` and restart the daemon.
- Automatic Git hook maintenance leaves working-tree and external hooks
    unchanged, including hooks reached through symlinks. Update these hooks
    explicitly with `roborev init`, `roborev install-hook`, or
    `roborev install-hook repair`. See
    [Git hook maintenance](/docs/guides/repository-management/#git-hook-maintenance).
- Agent Hook fix reminders assign one active fix session per worktree,
    preventing concurrent reminders from directing multiple sessions to edit it.
    Reminders also warn when the active fix skill is missing or outdated.
- `roborev refine` initializes private HTTPS submodules with your configured Git
    credentials.
- Claude Code hooks preserve Windows paths when Git Bash launches
    Scoop-installed roborev binaries.
- Non-agentic Pi reviews use read-only tools, plus the structured-output tool
    when needed. Agentic jobs and runs with `allow_unsafe_agents = true` retain
    Pi's default tools.
- Antigravity review tools use the exact review worktree as their workspace.
- Bundled Codex skills follow `AGENTS.md`. Branch-review skills fetch missing
    remote branches before retrying validation.
- Live logs show Agent Client Protocol tool calls and streamed plain text before
    a newline arrives. Empty logs display "Waiting for output...".
- Automatic colors use Windows Terminal's reported background when available.
    Explicit light and dark modes remain available if detection fails.
- Diffs containing invalid UTF-8 no longer prevent agents from reading review
    prompts. Repository files remain unchanged.
- Failed reviews in the web application show the recorded failure reason instead
    of a generic empty-output message.

## 0.67.0

<small>2026-08-26</small>

**New features**

- Teams can now compare two review configurations without repeatedly sorting
    branches into test groups. Each source branch stays in the same default or
    experimental group across daemon-backed and CI poller reviews. Explicit
    request settings still win, and `roborev config validate` checks an
    experiment without starting a review. See
    [Review Configuration Experiments](/docs/configuration/#review-configuration-experiments).
- Maintainers can skip automated reviews for pull requests that do not need one,
    such as drafts or generated updates. Add their labels to `[ci].skip_labels`;
    removing a label makes the current commit eligible again. GitHub App
    installations report the decision as a `skipped` check, while personal
    authentication skips the review without creating a check. See
    [GitHub Integration](/docs/integrations/github/#setup-with-github-app-recommended).
- Repositories with many small commits can now get one useful review instead of
    a stream of repetitive ones. Set `post_commit_batch_size` to review several
    commits together. Roborev tracks pending batches per branch across linked
    worktrees and tries to review any partial batch before a push. See
    [Post-Commit Reviews](/docs/automation/post-commit-reviews/#batch-small-commits).

**Improvements**

- Agent Hook fix reminders no longer turn into an open-ended cleanup of every
    review. The task you asked the agent to do remains the scope boundary. Each
    reminder names the exact reviews to handle and uses only the bundled
    `roborev-fix` skill; it does not search for unrelated work. Custom
    instructions still replace the default behavior completely.
- Fix agents now check each finding against the current code before changing
    anything. They close invalid findings with an explanation and leave valid
    but unrelated work open for you to decide, reducing speculative edits and
    surprise scope growth.
- Installing Agent Hook now also installs or refreshes the skills it needs for
    Claude Code, Codex, Factory Droid, and Grok Build. One command keeps the
    hook and its agent workflow in sync.

**Bug fixes**

- Large Antigravity reviews no longer fail when the prompt exceeds the operating
    system's command-line limit. Non-agentic reviews can also run the workspace
    inspection commands they need.
- You can select and copy text with the mouse from the split-screen TUI review
    pane again. Queue clicks and scrolling continue to work as before. See
    [Split-Screen Review](/docs/integrations/tui/#split-screen-review).
- Agent Hook no longer repeats the same fix reminder throughout an agent
    session. It remembers which reviews it already delivered while still
    surfacing genuinely new review work.

## 0.66.0

<small>2026-08-22</small>

**New features**

- Teams can now put the browser application behind an existing private-network
    login proxy instead of giving each user a Roborev token. Set
    `web.auth_mode = "proxy"`; the daemon validates the forwarded request before
    creating a restricted remote session. Local and token authentication still
    work as before. See
    [Proxy Authentication](/docs/web-ui/#proxy-authentication).
- The browser application can now live at a path such as `/roborev` on a shared
    domain. Set `web.base_path`, and Roborev applies it consistently to pages,
    assets, deep links, API calls, live events, and session cookies. This solves
    routing under a path prefix; it does not isolate Roborev from other apps on
    the same origin. See
    [Private Network Access](/docs/web-ui/#private-network-access).
- You can now give every fix agent the same standing instructions about which
    review suggestions to verify, apply, or intentionally reject. Set
    `fix_guidelines` in `~/.roborev/config.toml` to cover Agent Hook and
    foreground `roborev fix` sessions. Leaving it empty preserves the previous
    behavior. See [Fix Guidelines](/docs/configuration/#fix-guidelines).
- Agent Hook now shares the regular Roborev daemon, so there is only one
    background service to start, inspect, and reset. Existing counters are
    preserved. Before upgrading from a release that still runs the old helper
    daemon, stop it with that release's `roborev agent-hook daemon stop`
    command. See [Runtime Model](/docs/agent-hook/#runtime-model).

**Improvements**

- Updating Roborev no longer means blindly interrupting active review work.
    `roborev update` lets you wait, requeue interrupted attempts, or abort. New
    jobs stay queued until the replacement daemon is ready and running the new
    version. See [Update](/docs/commands/#update).
- Recent reviews are less likely to remain permanently unpriced when usage data
    arrives late. The daemon retries new misses and revisits eligible jobs from
    the previous week, even across restarts. Use `roborev backfill-tokens` for
    older history. See
    [Cost Usage Endpoint](/docs/configuration/#cost-usage-endpoint).
- Browser startup failures now tell you whether the UI was disabled in
    configuration or left out of the build. The same explanation appears in
    status, restart, UI, and version commands. Release checks also verify that
    published archives contain the production web application. See
    [Open the Application](/docs/web-ui/#open-the-application).
- Security reviews now spend less attention on known low-value warning classes.
    They compare changed code with the repository's established secure pattern
    and favor a smaller set of findings that developers can act on.
- Building Roborev from source now requires Go 1.27 across development, CI,
    release, screenshot, Nix, and CodeQL workflows. Published binaries remain
    self-contained. See
    [Build from Source](/docs/installation/#build-from-source).
- Source builds now use refreshed Go dependencies, including `grpc-go` 1.82.1,
    which is outside the range affected by `GHSA-hrxh-6v49-42gf`.

**Bug fixes**

- Pull and merge requests no longer receive misleading comments when a
    daemon-free CI agent fails to start or produces no review. Those errors stay
    in the CI job where operators can diagnose them.
- Failed agent jobs now finish promptly instead of hanging when a child process
    keeps an output stream open. Successful jobs still retain their complete
    output.
- Grok reasoning now appears as readable blocks instead of a separate terminal
    row for every streamed fragment.

**Acknowledgements**

    authentication, browser base paths, coordinated self-updates, delayed price

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.65.0

<small>2026-08-16</small>

**New features**

- You can now manage reviews in a full browser workspace. Run
    `roborev ui [job-id]` to browse and filter jobs, inspect panels, read
    rendered reviews, comment, open logs and prompts, and act on jobs. The
    analytics view shows volume, outcomes, failures, latency, agent attempts,
    estimated cost, and pricing coverage. Local access starts automatically;
    remote HTTPS deployments use a browser session without exposing the private
    CLI listener. See [Browser UI](/docs/web-ui/).
- Wide terminals now show the review queue and the selected review side by side,
    so you can triage without repeatedly opening and closing detail views. The
    layout activates at 140 columns by 36 rows, updates while jobs run, and can
    be toggled with `L`. Smaller terminals keep the existing stacked view. See
    [Split-Screen Review](/docs/integrations/tui/#split-screen-review).
- You can now ask supported agents for an exact reasoning effort: `low`,
    `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`. Roborev forwards the value unchanged,
    while the existing `fast`, `standard`, `thorough`, and `maximum` presets
    remain compatible. See
    [Reasoning Levels](/docs/configuration/#reasoning-levels).
- Pi users can now supply global launch arguments through
    `[agent.pi] launch_args`. This makes extension-provided model services
    available to isolated classifier jobs without weakening Roborev's agent
    discovery isolation. See
    [Pi Classifier Options](/docs/configuration/#pi-classifier-options).
- Teams can now export the cost of each CI attempt, including retries that a
    final panel summary cannot show. `roborev export ci-costs` supports stable
    cursors, refresh windows, correct missing-versus-zero prices, and backfill
    for older data so accounting pipelines can update incrementally. See
    [Exporting CI Costs](/docs/commands/#exporting-ci-costs).

**Improvements**

- Daemon commands now tell you exactly where to open the browser application.
    Start, restart, and the new canonical `roborev daemon status` command print
    its URL or explain that it is unavailable. `roborev status` remains an
    equivalent shortcut, and JSON status now includes `web_url`.
- Active Agent Hook snoozes are now visible instead of silently suppressing
    reminders. `roborev status` shows the affected repository, worktree, branch,
    and expiry; an exactly filtered TUI view shows a matching badge. See
    [Snoozing Reminders](/docs/agent-hook/#snoozing-reminders).
- Restarting the daemon no longer cuts off active reviews after a fixed timeout.
    Roborev stops taking new work, waits for reviews, hooks, and final sync to
    finish, and tells you what it is waiting for.
- Branch reviews launched from a linked worktree now review that worktree, even
    when shared or stale Git configuration points at a sibling checkout. See
    [Git Worktrees](/docs/guides/repository-management/#git-worktrees).
- Agent Hook now uses one consistent workflow across Claude Code, Codex, Copilot
    CLI, Cursor, Factory Droid, Gemini CLI, Hermes, and Qwen, while preserving
    Roborev's Grok integration. Existing Codex, Claude, and Droid registrations
    upgrade in place. See [Agent Hook](/docs/agent-hook/).
- Homebrew updates now come directly from official Roborev releases. The tap
    owns its formula updates, removing a duplicate publishing path and its
    cross-repository credential. See
    [Homebrew installation](/docs/installation/#homebrew-macos-linux).
- Building Roborev from source now requires Go 1.26.6. Go, JavaScript,
    documentation, and GitHub Actions dependencies were also refreshed,
    including fixes for known Go toolchain and `go-git` vulnerabilities.

**Bug fixes**

- Browser views no longer jump back to stale job state when a list refresh
    overlaps a live update. Cancellations and comments also appear in other open
    browser sessions without a manual refresh.
- Remote browser users can now cancel ordinary non-agentic reviews without
    gaining permission to rerun jobs. Logging out or letting the session expire
    also closes its live event streams.
- A failed rerun no longer displays output from an older attempt. Roborev shows
    saved output only when it belongs to the current attempt.
- Sandboxed clients no longer start a competing daemon just because they cannot
    access the usual loopback address or socket. Roborev preserves the
    permission error and can use the daemon's private Unix-socket fallback. See
    [Daemon & Hooks](/docs/commands/#daemon-hooks).
- New agent sessions now briefly retry delayed usage indexing before falling
    back to job-log token counts. This reduces missing cost estimates without
    making reviews wait indefinitely. See
    [Token Usage](/docs/commands/#token-usage).
- The Codex `maximum` preset now reaches the actual `max` tier for explicit
    GPT-5.6 `sol`, `terra`, and `luna` models. Older, default, and unknown
    models keep the compatible `xhigh` mapping, and an explicit `xhigh` remains
    distinct.

    upgrade.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.64.0

<small>2026-08-06</small>

**New features**

- GitLab users can now run Roborev directly in GitLab CI. `roborev ci review`
    finds the merge request's change range and creates or updates its review
    note. It supports GitLab.com, self-managed hosts, and explicit project,
    host, and merge request selection. See
    [GitLab Integration](/docs/integrations/gitlab/).
- Reviews and fix workflows can now use [Grok Build](https://x.ai/cli) as a
    first-class agent. Select `--agent grok` or `grok-build` for streamed
    reviews, resumed sessions, structured classification, agentic jobs, bundled
    skills, and Agent Hook. Reviews remain read-only; agentic work still
    requires the unsafe-agent opt-in. See
    [Grok Build](/docs/agents/#grok-build).
- You can now configure several named Agent Client Protocol (ACP) agents at
    once, each with its own command, model, backup, CI work, and synthesis
    settings. Repository configuration replaces only the global agent with the
    same name. Move existing `[acp]` plus `name = "foo"` configuration to
    `[acp.foo]`; this is a breaking configuration change. The guide includes a
    complete Goose setup using ChatGPT Codex subscription authentication. See
    [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](/docs/advanced/acp/).
- You can temporarily silence Agent Hook reminders without stopping reviews.
    `roborev snooze` affects only the current repository, linked worktree, and
    branch. The bundled Claude Code, Codex, and Factory Droid skills offer the
    same control. See
    [Snoozing Reminders](/docs/agent-hook/#snoozing-reminders).
- Bundled skills can now be installed where your agent actually looks for them,
    even when Roborev does not know that location. Use
    `roborev skills install --path <directory>` for agents such as Pi. See
    [Agent Skills](/docs/guides/agent-skills/).
- PostgreSQL sync credentials no longer have to appear directly in Roborev's
    configuration. A `${file:/absolute/path}` reference in `postgres_url` reads
    the password from a file, including when the daemon does not inherit your
    shell environment. See
    [Credential Expansion](/docs/advanced/postgres-sync/#credential-expansion).

**Improvements**

- Coding agents now return to the task they were doing after Agent Hook asks
    them to address findings. Multi-step work can continue from its existing
    specification, approval, or implementation checkpoint.
- Repositories can now keep review instructions in a root-level `REVIEW.md`
    instead of repeating them in configuration. Explicit `review_guidelines`
    still take precedence. Commit and range reviews read `REVIEW.md` from the
    default branch so a change cannot rewrite the policy used to review itself.
    See [Review Guidelines](/docs/configuration/#review-guidelines).
- `roborev check-agents` now tests the same configured wrapper or binary that
    review jobs will use, making a successful check meaningful for custom agent
    commands.
- Several post-commit hooks firing at once no longer queue duplicate automatic
    reviews of the same target. Explicit review commands still always create
    fresh work. See
    [Post-Commit Reviews](/docs/automation/post-commit-reviews/).
- CI panels that explicitly conclude there are no problems now report a passing
    verdict. Structured findings with failing severity still take precedence.
- Large job lists now use much less response data and temporary memory because
    completed prompts and review text are loaded only when callers need them.
    The TUI can still access prompts for active jobs.
- Reviewers now ask for tests that exercise behavior and failure boundaries, not
    tests that merely search source files or repeat implementation constants.

**Bug fixes**

- New reviews now retry briefly when usage indexing is a little late, reducing
    jobs that permanently show tokens but no cost.
- Commit ranges now look like ranges in CLI output: two shortened references
    separated by `..`, rather than one misleading truncated value.
- You can inspect a queued or running job's stored prompt with
    `roborev show --prompt <job_id>` instead of waiting for it to finish.
- Detached-HEAD reviews now show `(detached @ <shortsha>)` in the TUI instead of
    an unexplained blank Branch column.
- Cost backfill and displays now work with agentsview v0.39.0's
    `cost.microdollars` data while remaining compatible with the older
    `cost_usd` field.
- An empty Antigravity run now triggers retry or backup-agent handling instead
    of appearing as a successful review with no useful content. See
    [Gemini: Antigravity vs Legacy CLI](/docs/agents/#gemini-antigravity-vs-legacy-cli).

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.63.0

<small>2026-07-16</small>

**New features**

- Teams can now reduce review noise during a recurring part of the day without
    turning CI reviews off completely. Configure `[ci.quiet_hours]` with a start
    time, end time, timezone, and per-pull-request `throttle_interval`. This
    extra limit applies by default even to authors who bypass the normal CI
    throttle. See [Quiet Hours](/docs/integrations/github/#quiet-hours).
- Selected authors can bypass only the quiet-hours limit through
    `[ci.quiet_hours].bypass_users`. Add an author to
    `[ci].throttle_bypass_users` as well if they should bypass both limits. See
    [Quiet Hours Options](/docs/integrations/github/#quiet-hours-options).
- Automation can now tell whether `roborev run` launched work or skipped it
    without parsing terminal prose. Add `--json` to receive a stable receipt
    with the job identifiers, Git reference, and status, or a structured reason
    for a policy skip. See
    [Custom Tasks & Agentic Mode](/docs/advanced/custom-tasks/).

**Improvements**

- Pasting a log, transcript, quotation, or old finding that mentions a Roborev
    skill no longer starts that workflow by accident. The bundled `roborev-fix`
    skills act only on a current request or a direct Agent Hook instruction. See
    [Agent Skills](/docs/guides/agent-skills/#usage).

**Bug fixes**

- Reviews from tooling-managed detached-HEAD worktrees now regain their branch
    context when exactly one local branch contains the target commit. TUI
    grouping, fix and refine discovery, and hook matching work as they do in a
    normal checkout. Ambiguous commits remain branchless, and inferred branches
    still honor `excluded_branches`. See
    [Detached HEAD Worktrees](/docs/guides/repository-management/#detached-head-worktrees).

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for CI quiet-hours
    throttling and bypass controls, machine-readable task launch receipts, safer
    `roborev-fix` trigger boundaries, and detached-HEAD branch inference.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.62.1

<small>2026-07-13</small>

**New features**

- Teams can now export reliable CI panel history for reporting and analysis.
    Roborev saves the final outcome, retry timing, and synthesis agent and model
    when a panel finishes. `roborev export ci-metrics` includes member and
    synthesis timing, resumable cursors, database-reset detection, and optional
    backfill for older pre-panel history. See
    [Exporting CI Metrics](/docs/commands/#exporting-ci-metrics).
- Scripts can now read the installed tool name and build version without parsing
    human output. Use `roborev version --json` for a stable machine-readable
    response. See
    [Version JSON Contract](/docs/commands/#version-json-contract).

**Improvements**

- Long agent commands are now readable in the TUI Prompt view because they wrap
    by default. The Log view stays compact. Press `i` in either view to change
    that view independently. See
    [Prompt View](/docs/integrations/tui/#prompt-view).
- Agent Hook can still start the Codex `roborev-fix` loop it explicitly asks
    for, while every other bundled Codex skill requires a user's direct
    invocation. See [Agent Skills](/docs/guides/agent-skills/#usage).
- Nix users get the same supported outputs with one fewer transitive flake
    input; Roborev no longer depends on `flake-utils`.

**Bug fixes**

- An ACP backup agent no longer fails because it inherited a model meant for a
    different agent. Roborev ignores the mismatched model and keeps the ACP
    agent's own `[acp].model`. See
    [Backup Agents](/docs/configuration/#backup-agents).

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for persistent CI panel
    metrics and export, wrapped TUI prompt commands, and Codex Agent Hook skill
    invocation.
- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for the
    stable JSON version contract.
- Thanks to [Matthew Jacobs](https://github.com/mjacobs) for ACP backup-model
    pairing safeguards and expanded Gemini ACP documentation.
- Thanks to [Luis Quiñones](https://github.com/luisnquin) for simplifying the
    Nix flake dependencies.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.62.0

<small>2026-07-11</small>

**New features**

- You can now stop one queued or running job from the command line with
    `roborev cancel <job_id>`. Jobs that already finished cannot be canceled.
    See [Canceling a Job](/docs/commands/#canceling-a-job).

**Improvements**

- Codex and Claude Code no longer start bundled Roborev workflows merely because
    a request resembles one. You must select the skill directly through the
    agent's supported skill, command, or menu interface; ordinary review and fix
    requests stay in the agent's native workflow. See
    [Agent Skills](/docs/guides/agent-skills/#usage).
- Custom Claude Code and Codex configuration directories now work across skill
    installation, status checks, updates, and Agent Hook installation. Roborev
    honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CODEX_HOME`, with the usual home-directory
    locations as fallbacks. See
    [Agent Skills](/docs/guides/agent-skills/#how-it-works).
- The ACP guide now shows how to choose Gemini models through an Antigravity SDK
    bridge, including thinking-level suffixes, daemon environment setup, and
    agent and model troubleshooting. See
    [Model-Selectable Gemini via a Bridge](/docs/advanced/acp/#example-model-selectable-gemini-via-a-bridge).

**Bug fixes**

- Selecting an ACP agent no longer pairs it with a workflow model intended for
    another agent. The ACP agent keeps its configured model unless you pass
    `--model` or configure a model for that same agent.
- Antigravity reviews now use the prompt method supported by the installed `agy`
    version, fixing launches across versions through 1.1.0 and from 1.1.1
    onward.
- Committing no longer lets the pre-commit lint hook rewrite files unexpectedly.
    Hooks use the check-only `make lint-ci` target; `make lint` remains the
    deliberate command for applying fixes.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Matthew Jacobs](https://github.com/mjacobs) for `roborev cancel`,
    the model-selectable Gemini ACP documentation, and ACP model-pairing fixes.
- Thanks to [Yo Iida](https://github.com/y011d4) for honoring custom Claude Code
    and Codex configuration directories during skill installation.
- Thanks to [Graham Taylor](https://github.com/gwtaylor) for Antigravity version
    compatibility.
- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for explicit-only Codex and
    Claude Code skills and non-mutating pre-commit lint checks.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.61.2

<small>2026-07-04</small>

**New features**

- Collapsed TUI panel rows now show how long the whole review took, from the
    first reviewer starting through synthesis finishing, instead of showing only
    the final synthesis time.

**Improvements**

- Callers that only need job status can now leave prompts and diffs out of job
    listings. This makes daemon and Agent Hook responses smaller and avoids
    exposing review inputs where they are not needed.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for TUI panel wall-clock
    elapsed time.
- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for slimmer
    metadata-only job listings that omit prompt payloads.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.61.1

<small>2026-07-02</small>

**New features**

- Data pipelines can now fetch only reviews completed since their previous
    export. `roborev export reviews` returns a stable database identifier and an
    opaque next cursor; pass that cursor back with `--cursor` to resume without
    rereading old rows. See
    [Exporting Reviews](/docs/commands/#exporting-reviews).

**Improvements**

- Agents and other tools can now read the documentation as source Markdown.
    Deployments publish `/changelog.md`, `/index.md`, and the sources for pages
    listed in the navigation alongside their rendered HTML.
- CI review comments now use simple numbered reviewer labels and one combined
    status footer. Internal panel identifiers no longer clutter pull requests or
    confuse later fix workflows.
- The refine guide now directs users to Agent Hook when they want an active
    Codex or Claude Code session to pick up review fixes automatically. See
    [Auto-Fix with Refine](/docs/guides/auto-fixing/).

**Bug fixes**

- CI reviews delayed by a provider outage or quota limit can resume immediately
    after a daemon restart instead of waiting for an obsolete in-memory retry
    timer.
- Hook-triggered reviews now collect repository metadata more reliably and with
    less process overhead, especially on Windows. Unsupported repository formats
    still fall back to Git subprocesses.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for incremental review
    export cursors, public Markdown source publishing, CI review comment
    metadata improvements, and CI startup retry recovery.
- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for the
    refine documentation update and more reliable review enqueue metadata
    collection.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.61.0

<small>2026-06-30</small>

**New features**

- You can now export completed review history as JSON for reporting, analysis,
    or archival. `roborev export reviews` offers content or metadata profiles
    and filters for date, repository, project, closed state, and count. Panel
    results appear once, with their completed member reviews nested below. See
    [Exporting Reviews](/docs/commands/#exporting-reviews).
- Time-series projects can now ask for a review dedicated to accidental use of
    future data. Run `roborev review --type lookahead` to check for look-ahead
    bias, future-data leakage, incorrect point-in-time joins, temporal split
    mistakes, and related defects. See
    [Review Types](/docs/guides/reviewing-code/#review-types).
- Factory Droid users can now use Agent Hook and Roborev's bundled review, fix,
    refine, response, design-review, and lookahead skills, including branch
    variants. Install the user-scoped hook with
    `roborev agent-hook install --agent droid`. See
    [Agent Hook](/docs/agent-hook/).
- Each analysis workflow can now choose the agent, model, and reasoning effort
    best suited to it. Configure `[analyze.<type>]` so refactoring and other
    analyses do not have to share the general review defaults. See
    [Workflow-Specific Agent and Model](/docs/configuration/#workflow-specific-agent-and-model).
- CI review failures can now alert a Discord channel. Set
    `[ci] discord_webhook_url` to enable best-effort notifications; Roborev
    masks the sensitive URL in configuration output. See
    [CI Options Reference](/docs/integrations/github/#ci-options-reference).

**Improvements**

- Slow repositories and Windows checkouts can now give the post-commit hook more
    time to reach the daemon. Set `hook_timeout_seconds`; Windows defaults to 30
    seconds and other platforms to 3. Reading repository configuration no longer
    adds a Git subprocess to the hook.
- Updates now tolerate slower release downloads and repair registered
    Roborev-managed Git hooks afterward, so managed installations keep invoking
    the new binary.
- The documentation now shows how `[analyze.<type>]` applies to analysis types
    such as `lookahead` that have no extra fields.

**Bug fixes**

- PostgreSQL synchronization no longer fails when prompts, diffs, errors, or
    other job text contain invalid UTF-8 or NUL bytes. Roborev cleans those
    values before writing them to Postgres.

## 0.60.0

<small>2026-06-25</small>

**New features**

- `roborev quickstart` now provides guided setup and automation onboarding for
    repository setup, review tuning, and post-commit review workflows.
- Codex jobs now support explicit `-c` config passthrough overrides through
    `[agent.codex.config]`, so teams can opt into custom Codex providers without
    loading the full user config. See
    [Custom Codex Config](/docs/configuration/#custom-codex-config-model-providers).

**Improvements**

- Onboarding docs now center automation-first workflows, including post-commit
    reviews, agent hooks, review tuning, and agent-oriented setup guidance.
- Git hook and agent hook installers now prefer managed `roborev` shims when
    available, keeping generated hook commands stable across version-manager
    upgrades.

**Bug fixes**

- `roborev refine` now rejects dirty or changed submodule state before applying
    agent output, avoiding accidental overwrite of local submodule edits.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for `roborev quickstart`,
    the automation-first docs revamp, and safer submodule handling in
    `roborev refine`.

    shim preference in hook installation.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.59.2

<small>2026-06-24</small>

**New features**

- Copilot review output now prefers structured JSON when the installed CLI
    supports it, so roborev can store complete assistant findings instead of
    truncated process output.
- `roborev fix` now includes completed `analyze` jobs when discovering open
    findings, so queued analysis results can be fixed without passing each job
    ID explicitly. See
    [Applying Fixes from Analysis](/docs/guides/assisted-refactoring/#applying-fixes-from-analysis).

**Improvements**

- Homebrew tap updates now open pull requests against `kenn-io/homebrew-tap`
    instead of pushing directly to the protected tap branch.
- Workflow-configured reviews, fixes, panels, CI members, and synthesis now use
    only the preferred agent or an explicitly configured backup. See
    [Backup Agents](/docs/configuration/#backup-agents).
- `roborev analyze` agent invocation is more stable across local setups,
    including Gemini/Antigravity selection, capability probes from deleted
    worktrees, and Codex stored-prompt jobs.

**Bug fixes**

- Quota-only or provider-unavailable panel runs no longer store misleading
    failed synthesis reviews when every member was skipped for availability
    reasons.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.59.1

<small>2026-06-22</small>

**New features**

- Configurable fix commit metadata. Set `fix_commit_author` and
    `fix_commit_co_authored_by` globally or per repo to control author metadata
    for `roborev refine` commits, background fix commits applied from the TUI,
    and prompt instructions for foreground `roborev fix` and
    `roborev analyze --fix` commits. See
    [Fix Commit Metadata](/docs/configuration/#fix-commit-metadata).
- Tolerated panel member failures. Mark a panel subagent with
    `allow_failure = true` when that reviewer is useful but flaky, so a
    transient failure or cancellation does not fail an otherwise usable panel
    result. See [Subagents](/docs/advanced/subagent-review-panels/#subagents).

**Improvements**

- Pi job logs now render trace-style message and tool output instead of exposing
    raw event JSON, making Pi review sessions easier to inspect in CLI and TUI
    logs.
- Panel parent rows and CI comment footers now surface known member costs even
    when some panel work is still pending or unpriced, with partial coverage
    clearly marked where comments include costs.
- Expanded documentation for configuration, GitHub integration, review
    workflows, auto-fix/refine workflows, and subagent review panels.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.59.0

<small>2026-06-22</small>

**New features**

- Repository-hosted documentation. The roborev.io docs now live in this
    repository, with guides, command reference, integration docs,
    troubleshooting, and a local Zensical build/check workflow. See
    [Docs Maintainer Guide](/docs/development/#documentation).
- Global review guidelines. Set `review_guidelines` in `~/.roborev/config.toml`
    to apply shared reviewer instructions across repositories. Repo-level
    `review_guidelines` are appended after the global text by default; set
    `review_guidelines_supersede_global = true` in `.roborev.toml` when a repo
    should replace the global guidance. See
    [Review Guidelines](/docs/configuration/#review-guidelines).
- Hook-only auto-design routing. `[auto_design_review] hook_enabled = true` runs
    the design-review router for post-commit hook reviews without also enabling
    it for manual reviews or CI. See
    [Auto Design Review](/docs/configuration/#auto-design-review).

**Improvements**

- `roborev status` is more responsive because it no longer performs slow
    repository config probes while rendering status.
- CLI startup is faster because terminal capability probing is no longer
    imported during startup.
- CI review retries keep using the agents configured for the PR instead of being
    derailed by daemon quota cooldowns.
- Agent quota cooldowns can now be capped with `agent_quota_cooldown`, a global
    Go-duration config value that defaults to `30m`.
- CI review worktrees are grouped under repo-named parent directories, making
    daemon clone/worktree storage easier to inspect.
- Security review prompts are stricter about reporting only concrete,
    exploitable issues and avoiding generic low-signal findings.
- Agent-hook continuation prompts now tell the agent to fix roborev issues and
    then continue the interrupted task, reducing session derailment.
- Self-update and install release discovery are more resilient when GitHub API
    rate limits are hit.

**Bug fixes**

- Hidden Windows console windows for daemon, git, and agent child processes.
- Fixed Windows summary filtering behavior.
- Fixed Codex token usage backfill and reporting.
- Fixed `check-agents` availability checks so configured command overrides such
    as `codex_cmd` and `claude_code_cmd` are honored.
- Improved `roborev fix` discovery so it targets failing reviews and follows
    hook lineage correctly, including branchless and detached-head flows.

**Acknowledgements**

    faster `status`, lighter CLI startup, capped quota cooldowns, CI

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.58

<small>2026-06-11</small>

**New features**

- Kata integration. Local reviews can include task context from a repo's bound
    Kata project, either from the Kata issues referenced in reviewed commit
    messages or from the open Kata backlog. Review hooks can also file failed
    reviews and review findings back into Kata. See
    [Kata Integration](/docs/configuration/#kata-integration) and
    [Built-in: Kata Integration](/docs/guides/hooks/#built-in-kata-integration).
- Branch filtering for review hooks. Add `branches = ["main", "release/*"]` to a
    `[[hooks]]` entry to run it only for matching branches. Local reviews match
    the job branch; CI PR reviews match the PR base branch so protected-branch
    workflows can target `main` or release branches. See
    [Branch Filtering](/docs/guides/hooks/#branch-filtering).
- Queue pause and resume controls. `roborev pause`, `roborev unpause`, and the
    TUI `P` shortcut pause queue processing without canceling running jobs.
    Queued jobs remain queued until the queue is resumed. See
    [Queue Pause](/docs/integrations/tui/#queue-pause).
- Aggregate review cost tracking. `roborev cost` shows approximate all-time or
    scoped agent spend, and `roborev summary` now includes windowed cost
    coverage. See [Aggregate Cost](/docs/commands/#aggregate-cost).
- Public daemon Go client. External integrations can import
    `go.kenn.io/roborev/pkg/client` for a typed client generated from the daemon
    OpenAPI contract, with raw helpers for streaming/log endpoints. See
    [Public Go Client](/docs/advanced/streaming/#public-go-client).
- Binary overrides for agent hooks. `roborev agent-hook install --binary <path>`
    bakes a stable roborev shim or explicit binary path into Codex and Claude
    Code hook configs, mirroring the git-hook `roborev init --binary` workflow.
    See [Agent Hook installation](/docs/agent-hook/#install).

**Improvements**

- Preserve user `safe.directory` Git config when running with Git config
    isolation.
- TUI queue and status displays now surface paused queues with a persistent
    `[PAUSED]` marker and show approximate aggregate cost for the active filter
    scope.
- CI panel synthesis now defers and retries on quota or transient synthesis
    failures instead of posting degraded raw member output.
- Pi classifier setup guidance now explicitly points users at the JSON schema
    extension install step. See
    [Pi Structured Output](/docs/agents/#pi-structured-output).

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed Windows daemon restart failures.
- Prevented unwanted Windows console pop-ups when starting daemon and
    process-management commands.
- Improved Windows daemon/process cleanup behavior.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for queue
    pause controls, the generated public daemon client, agent-hook binary
    overrides, preserving user `safe.directory` config, Windows daemon/process
    fixes, and clearer Pi classifier extension setup guidance.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.57.1

<small>2026-06-08</small>

**New features**

- Ship Windows releases as both `.zip` and `.tar.gz` archives.
- Add a daemon route for agentsview token backfill.

**Improvements**

- Improve TUI queue rendering performance.
- Speed up TUI queue startup by reducing repeated display-name lookups.
- Reduce git command overhead on Windows ARM systems.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix PowerShell 5.x install failures on Windows when handling redirects.
- Fix TUI freezes when using multi-repo filters.
- Allow agentsview usage without version-gating.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.57

<small>2026-06-05</small>

**New features**

- Agent hook integration. The new `roborev agent-hook` command plugs into Codex
    and Claude Code harness hooks and prompts the agent to run `$roborev-fix`
    once review work piles up, so reviews get fixed inside the agent session.
    See [Agent Hook](/docs/agent-hook/).
- Subagent review panels for CI and manual daemon reviews. A panel fans one
    review target out to named reviewer specs, then produces one synthesis
    parent review that is the actionable row for `show`, `list`, `wait`, fix
    workflows, and the TUI. CI now uses the same panel system; existing
    `agents`, `review_types`, and `[ci.reviews]` configs become an implicit
    panel when `[ci] panel` is not set. See
    [Subagent Review Panels](/docs/advanced/subagent-review-panels/) and
    [Named CI Panels](/docs/integrations/github/#named-ci-panels).
- Safer CI review retries. The CI poller now tracks retry state per PR HEAD,
    defers transient provider outages without posting misleading comments,
    retries genuine member failures up to a bounded cap, and rechecks PR open
    state, HEAD SHA, and repo identity before retrying or posting. See
    [Safe CI Retries](/docs/integrations/github/#safe-ci-retries).
- Anonymous daemon telemetry. roborev sends limited anonymous daemon lifecycle
    telemetry on startup and once every 24 hours while running, with repo and
    review counts plus high-level feature flags. It does not send repo names,
    paths, remotes, prompts, review output, provider tokens, usernames, or IP
    geolocation. Disable with `ROBOREV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` or
    `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0`. See [Telemetry](/docs/configuration/#telemetry).
- DEB and RPM release artifacts. Linux releases now include `.deb` and `.rpm`
    packages for `amd64` and `arm64`, including user-level systemd units. See
    [Linux Packages](/docs/installation/#linux-packages-deb-and-rpm).

**Improvements**

- TUI review and queue panel refinements, plus a new `i` toggle in log and
    prompt views that expands or collapses the full command line used for a job.
    See [Terminal UI](/docs/integrations/tui/#log-view).
- `compact` now requires the consolidated review to repeat each remaining
    finding with actionable detail (severity, file/line, description). Outputs
    that report findings only as counts or summaries are rejected instead of
    stored, so a compacted review cannot claim findings it never lists. Clean
    verifications are unaffected. See
    [Consolidating Reviews](/docs/commands/#consolidating-reviews).
- Cost lookup can be routed through a configurable HTTP usage endpoint instead
    of the local `agentsview` CLI. See
    [Cost Usage Endpoint](/docs/configuration/#cost-usage-endpoint).
- Update discovery now uses GitHub's HTML redirect endpoint for latest release
    checks, avoiding GitHub API rate limits.
- Raised the default CI `batch_timeout` from 3 minutes to 15 minutes. Set
    `batch_timeout = "0"` to disable. See
    [CI Options Reference](/docs/integrations/github/#ci-options-reference).
- Improved dependency metadata filtering to reduce false-positive findings.
- Default review prompts now put `No issues found.` on its own line for cleaner
    pass output.
- Improved classifier support, including Pi schema-based classifier output
    through the configured JSON schema extension. See
    [Pi Classifier Options](/docs/configuration/#pi-classifier-options).

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed CI reviews using stale checkouts.
- Fixed worktrees finding `.roborev.toml` when it is gitignored in the main
    repo.
- Fixed review retry log handling and retained classifier job logs.
- Fixed Claude classifier structured output parsing.
- Fixed hook binary resolution for managed installs.
- Fixed the OpenCode install source. See
    [Supported Agents](/docs/agents/#supported-agents).
- Fixed Copilot streaming behavior when the agent supports disabling streaming.
- Grounded reviewer version checks in the project toolchain.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.56

<small>2026-05-24</small>

**New features**

- Per-job cost estimate in the TUI queue. A new default-visible "Cost" column
    shows the agentsview-provided cost estimate alongside the existing token
    counts; the review detail header appends `· ~$0.42` to the usage summary.
    Cost data requires agentsview 0.30.0 or newer (which adds
    `agentsview session usage <id> --format json` with `cost_usd`/`has_cost`
    fields); on older versions the column stays blank and token counts are
    unaffected. Run `roborev backfill-tokens` to refresh existing jobs once
    agentsview is upgraded. See [Token Usage](/docs/commands/#token-usage).
- Agent plugin manifests for Claude Code and Codex. The repository now ships
    `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and
    `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` pointing at the same Claude and Codex skill
    trees that `roborev skills install` uses. This lets users install roborev
    skills through each agent's plugin distribution channel in addition to the
    existing CLI installer.
- Repo-local oversized-diff snapshots. The default snapshot root moves from OS
    temp space to `.roborev/` under the repo, set per-repo via a new
    `snapshot_dir` field in `.roborev.toml`. `roborev init` ensures the
    configured directory is ignored in `.gitignore`; snapshot creation also
    writes a local `.git/info/exclude` fallback for repos whose ignore setup is
    stale. `snapshot_dir` must be a relative path under the repo root and may
    not be inside `.git`. See
    [Prompt Size Budget](/docs/configuration/#prompt-size-budget).

**Improvements**

- Prefer the Antigravity `agy` CLI for the Gemini agent. Google has deprecated
    the legacy `gemini` CLI; roborev now picks `agy` first when both are
    installed and falls back to `gemini` otherwise. Antigravity runs in
    `--print` mode with prompts piped over stdin and maps review/agentic
    permissions to `--sandbox` and `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Antigravity
    does not yet accept a `--model` flag, so model overrides automatically
    reroute to `gemini` if it is installed; when only `agy` is available, an
    explicit `--model` returns a clear error instead of being silently ignored.
    See [Supported Agents](/docs/agents/#supported-agents).
- Design review prompt gains an "Internal contradictions" check as the new
    top-priority item. This flags places where two parts of a spec, PRD, or task
    list conflict even when each part is individually clear, so downstream
    agents do not resolve the conflict differently and produce inconsistent
    implementations. The original five-bullet rubric (completeness, feasibility,
    task scoping, missing considerations, clarity) is preserved as items 2
    through 6.
- CLI errors no longer dump the full usage block on runtime failures. The usage
    block now prints for invocation errors only (unknown flags, mutually
    exclusive flags, bad enum values, unknown subcommands, invalid `--server`);
    runtime errors (daemon down, invalid git ref, network failure) print just
    `Error: ...`. Caller-controlled exits (`review --wait` with a Fail verdict,
    `wait` with multiple jobs) remain silent with the correct exit code.
    `--quiet` continues to silence the verdict output but still surfaces runtime
    error messages, matching CLI convention.
- The `/roborev-fix` skills for Claude Code and Codex now require closing each
    addressed review before handling any post-fix auto-reviews, and add explicit
    per-job `closed=true` audit guidance so the skill cannot leave reviews open
    after applying fixes.

**Bug fixes**

- Retry backoff is now enforced per job rather than per worker. A new
    `retry_not_before` column on `review_jobs` (added by a SQLite migration and
    the postgres v13 schema) stamps the earliest claim time when a job is
    retried, and `ClaimJob` filters on it across the entire worker pool. The
    previous in-worker `time.Sleep` only paused the worker that failed; with
    `--max-workers > 1`, other workers would claim the retry immediately and
    inherit the same broken state. Failover clears the column so a fresh agent
    is not held by the prior gate. Default backoff is 2s.
- The CI batch poller no longer unclaims batches that were finalized by a racing
    event path. Stale-claim recovery now checks the batch's terminal state
    before reverting it. Permanent GitHub access errors on moved or deleted
    repositories finalize the batch instead of retrying forever.
- `roborev init` works in worktrees backed by `git clone --bare`. The git helper
    now detects linked worktrees whose common git directory is bare and resolves
    them to the checkout root, so Middleman-style bare-backed worktrees can be
    registered. Behavior for normal linked worktrees and submodule worktrees is
    unchanged.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.55

<small>2026-05-15</small>

**New features**

- `security` analyze type runs `roborev analyze security <files>` with a
    security-focused prompt covering authn/authz, trust boundaries, injection,
    file/secret handling, cryptography, and dependency risks. Jobs are tagged
    `review_type = security` so `security_agent` and `security_model` config
    (and the per-reasoning-level variants) apply automatically. See
    [Code Analysis](/docs/commands/#code-analysis).
- `roborev status --json` emits structured daemon and queue status, including
    the active daemon endpoint as `network`, `address`, and `port` fields so
    scripts and integrations can discover the listening transport without
    reading runtime files.

**Improvements**

- Review templates for Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini drop the "diff and static
    analysis only" framing and explicitly permit reading other repo files to
    verify claims. Agents are still prohibited from building, running tests, or
    executing code; the change reduces false-negative findings (e.g. "this
    package doesn't exist") on PRs that reference code outside the diff.
    Non-templated agents (Copilot, OpenCode, Cursor, Kiro, Kilo, Droid, Pi) use
    the fallback prompt and are unchanged.
- The TUI queue hides auto-design-router classifier jobs (`job_type = classify`)
    and skipped design rows (`status = skipped`, scoped to
    `source = auto_design`) by default to reduce per-commit routing noise. A new
    `show_classify_jobs` global config (with nullable per-repo override) and an
    `s` TUI hotkey toggle visibility; the queue footer and `?` help screen
    reflect the current state. Pressing `l` on a hidden classifier or skipped
    row shows the classifier verdict and `skip_reason` above the streamed log.
    The daemon status endpoint's skipped/triggered counters are unchanged. See
    [Auto Design Review](/docs/configuration/#auto-design-review).
- Codex review jobs default to `skills.include_instructions=false` and
    `--ignore-user-config`, so review prompts run without skill instructions or
    user-level Codex config. Two global toggles under `[agent.codex]` control
    this (`disable_review_skills`, `ignore_review_user_config`); both default to
    `true`. Fix jobs are not affected. See
    [Codex Review Options](/docs/configuration/#codex-review-options).

**Bug fixes**

- Gemini-based reviews can now read external diff snapshots. The Gemini agent
    receives the per-snapshot temp directory in its allowed-paths list (matching
    the Codex `--add-dir` behavior introduced in 0.54), restoring access to the
    expected context for large diffs.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for
    disabling Codex review skill context by default, adding security analyze
    mode, and exposing the daemon endpoint in JSON status output.
- Thanks to [Phillip Cloud](https://github.com/cpcloud) for allowing review
    agents to read repo files when verifying diffs, exposing Gemini diff
    snapshot directories, and hiding auto-design-router noise from the queue by
    default.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.54

<small>2026-05-07</small>

**New features**

- `--batch-size N` flag on `roborev fix` to pack up to N reviews into a single
    agent invocation, still bounded by the configured `max_prompt_size`. This
    sits between the default one-fix-per-prompt mode and `--batch` (everything
    in one prompt): you get coordinated multi-finding fixes per call without
    exceeding the prompt budget. Mutually exclusive with `--batch` and `--list`.
    See [Fixing Reviews](/docs/commands/#fixing-reviews).
- `--resume` flag on `roborev fix` to reuse the agent's session ID across calls
    within a single fix run, so chained fixes build on prior context instead of
    starting fresh each call. Defaults to off.

**Improvements**

- Large diff prompts are kept in external snapshot files instead of being
    expanded back into agent prompts. roborev now applies an agent-agnostic
    final prompt-size gate before submission and treats context-window failures
    as non-retryable failover candidates rather than retrying the same oversized
    prompt. Snapshots are written to per-snapshot temp directories that are
    readable by all agents.
- Review prompts now instruct agents to separate multiple findings with `---` on
    its own line so findings render as distinct entries instead of running
    together. Applies across the default, dirty, range, and security templates
    as well as the Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini variants.
- The README header logo uses a dark-background variant on GitHub dark mode (via
    a `<picture>` element with `prefers-color-scheme`), so the dark-text logo no
    longer becomes unreadable on dark backgrounds.

**Bug fixes**

- The foreground `roborev fix` loop now classifies agent errors and aborts
    cleanly when it detects a quota or session limit, instead of demoting these
    failures to per-job warnings during discovery mode. A new `internal/agent`
    rate-limit classifier (`LimitKind`, `LimitClassification`,
    `ParseResetDuration`, `ParseResetTime`) is shared between the daemon worker
    and the CLI fix loop, so cooldown behavior is consistent across both paths
    and unmatched agent errors are logged with a truncated preview instead of
    being silent.
- Codex large-diff snapshots are written to per-snapshot subdirectories, and
    Codex receives the snapshot directory via `--add-dir` instead of full `/tmp`
    access. This restores Codex's ability to read external diff snapshots while
    avoiding exposure of unrelated `/tmp` contents. Snapshot-shaped paths in
    prompts are ignored unless they resolve to existing files inside a private
    roborev snapshot directory.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for exposing
    Codex diff snapshot directories and keeping large diff prompts external.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.53.1

<small>2026-05-04</small>

**Improvements**

- ACP session validation: the first ACP session update is validated against the
    agent's configured session ID before being stored. Mismatches are logged but
    no longer return errors, avoiding connection breaks during normal operation.
- ACP model resolution: `ModelForSelectedAgent` falls back to the model
    configured in the `[acp]` section when no workflow-specific model is set,
    giving consistent model selection across review, analyze, fix, refine, and
    daemon paths.
- Clearer error messages for invalid ACP configuration and model settings, with
    improved permission handling during session setup.

**Bug fixes**

- `review --branch`, `analyze --branch`, and `refine` correctly auto-detect the
    branch base when the upstream is configured as a raw URL (e.g.
    `https://example.com/fork.git`) rather than a registered remote name.
    URL-shaped values previously produced invalid refs like
    `refs/remotes/https://.../main` that failed to resolve, breaking branch-base
    detection for affected repos. roborev now detects URL-shaped remote values
    via prefix and `://` checks, after first confirming the value is not a
    registered remote name, and falls through to the next detection step.
- Per-branch `branch.<name>.base` overrides are now consulted by review, refine,
    and analyze flows. The override was already documented as a per-branch base
    override but was being skipped in favor of upstream-tracking detection.

<small>2026-04-30</small>

**New features**

- Opt-in automatic design-review router. roborev can now decide per commit
    whether to dispatch a `--type design` review, using cheap heuristics first
    (path globs, diff size, file count, commit-subject regexes) and a
    schema-constrained classifier as a fallback for ambiguous cases. Off by
    default; turn it on globally with `[auto_design_review] enabled = true` in
    `~/.roborev/config.toml` or per repo in `.roborev.toml`. The post-commit,
    `roborev review`, range, and dirty paths and the CI poller all consult the
    router; design jobs are emitted only when the router says yes, otherwise a
    skipped row is recorded with the deciding reason and rendered dimmed in the
    TUI. Classifier behavior is tunable via `classify_agent`, `classify_model`,
    `classify_reasoning`, `classify_backup_agent`, and `classify_backup_model`.
    The classifier requires a `SchemaAgent`-capable backend (Claude Code,
    Codex); other agents are rejected at config-resolve time. See
    [Auto Design Review](/docs/configuration/#auto-design-review).

**Improvements**

- Daemon HTTP API consolidated under [Huma](https://huma.rocks/). Routes,
    request and response types, and handlers move to a single Huma-backed
    registration in `internal/daemon/routes.go`, and the OpenAPI spec served at
    `/openapi.json` is now available in both 3.1 (default) and 3.0 (downgraded)
    flavors. The TUI talks to the daemon through a generated OpenAPI client
    (`internal/daemon_client`) for normal JSON calls; streaming endpoints
    continue to use plain handlers. This is internal plumbing; existing CLI and
    TUI behavior is unchanged.
- The CI poller runs the auto design-review router on the PR head SHA when
    `design` is not already in the configured review matrix. Heuristic-input
    failures (missing diff, changed-files, or commit message) degrade to the
    classifier instead of being silently skipped, so misconfigured repos surface
    a real outcome.
- Shell completion for `roborev review --type` suggests `security` and `design`,
    matching the existing pattern for `--agent` and `--reasoning`. Tab-complete
    the value directly without typing it out.
- New `roborev repo move <name-or-path> <new-path>` subcommand updates a tracked
    repository's stored root path after a directory rename or move on disk, so
    existing jobs and reviews stay attached to the same repo entry. See
    [Repository Management](/docs/guides/repository-management/#moving-or-renaming-a-repository).

**Bug fixes**

- `roborev fix` now discovers reviews when run from a detached HEAD. Open-job
    filtering walks the commit chain back to the first reachable branch tip and
    matches jobs against the detached commits and review ranges that end on
    them. `dirty` jobs and unrelated refs remain excluded.
- The TUI's `auto_filter_repo` startup filter now reconciles renamed and moved
    repos through their stored display name and identity, so renamed
    repositories still surface their existing reviews instead of appearing
    empty.
- `review --branch`, `analyze --branch`, `refine`, and the post-commit
    branch-review path now resolve the merge-base against the current branch's
    `@{upstream}` (e.g. `upstream/main` in fork workflows), falling back to the
    configured default branch only when no upstream is set. The previous
    behavior pulled in commits already merged upstream when the local
    `origin/main` was behind. The `currentBranch == LocalBranchName(base)`
    guardrail is replaced by `git.IsOnBaseBranch`, which generalizes the
    `origin/` shortcut, handles non-origin remotes, and stops misclassifying
    local branches whose names contain slashes (e.g. `feature/foo`).
- Tab-completing `roborev review --type <TAB>` no longer falls through to
    filename completion when no value has been typed yet. The completion now
    returns just `security` and `design` and disables filename fallback.
- Claude Code's durable scheduled-task files (`.claude/scheduled_tasks.json`,
    `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock`) are added to `.gitignore` so the harness's
    local cron state does not get accidentally tracked.

**Acknowledgements**

    detached-HEAD review discovery, migrating the daemon API to Huma, and
    completing review type flag support.

## 0.52

<small>2026-04-19</small>

**New features**

- Route Claude Code through an OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible proxy (Ollama,
    LiteLLM, LM Studio, etc.) via a `<model>@<base_url>` model spec. When a
    proxy URL is present, roborev pins all Claude Code tier aliases
    (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku/subagent) to the specified model and points the agent at
    the given endpoint, making it possible to use local models for reviews and
    fixes. See
    [Routing Claude Code to a proxy](/docs/agents/#routing-claude-code-to-a-proxy).

**Improvements**

- Review prompts are more consistent across agents, with reduced low-value noise
    in review output.
- Streamed tool-call names and input fields are normalized across agents for
    cleaner agent output in the TUI and daemon logs.
- OpenCode output shows tool calls and drops migration noise from `stderr`.

**Bug fixes**

- TUI clipboard copy works over SSH by falling back to OSC52 escape sequences
    when a local clipboard is unavailable.
- `j`, `k`, and `q` can be typed normally while editing TUI filter searches,
    instead of being captured as navigation/quit shortcuts.
- Gemini severity threshold parsing no longer fails when marker strings include
    internal whitespace.

!!! warning

    Breaking change: when the `claude-code` agent runs, roborev now strips inherited
    `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`,
    `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU}_MODEL`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`
    from the child environment. If you were routing Claude Code by exporting these
    variables in your shell, switch to the `<model>@<base_url>` spec or configure
    `anthropic_api_key` in `~/.roborev/config.toml`.

## 0.51

<small>2026-04-08</small>

**New features**

- OpenAPI spec for the daemon REST API, served at `/openapi.json` (OpenAPI 3.1.0
    via Huma). The spec covers the primary query and mutation endpoints used by
    integrations (jobs, reviews, comments, repos, branches, status, summary,
    cancel, rerun, close). Internal endpoints used by the CLI, TUI, and daemon
    subsystems (enqueue, streaming, sync, fix orchestration) are not part of the
    OpenAPI surface. See
    [Streaming & Daemon API](/docs/advanced/streaming/#daemon-api).
- Cascading `review_min_severity` setting and `--min-severity` flag on
    `roborev review` to filter review findings by severity. The setting cascades
    from CLI flag to per-repo `.roborev.toml` to global `config.toml`, matching
    the existing pattern for `fix_min_severity` and `refine_min_severity`.
    Global defaults for all three (`review_min_severity`, `fix_min_severity`,
    `refine_min_severity`) are now supported in global config. See
    [Configuration](/docs/configuration/#per-repository-options).

**Improvements**

- Branch review prompts include per-commit review context. When reviewing a
    commit range, the prompt includes summaries and verdicts from individual
    per-commit reviews, with instructions to focus on cross-commit interactions
    instead of re-raising known issues.
- Fix prompts include user comments and prior tool attempts. Developer comments
    and previous automated fix attempts are separated and included in the
    prompt, giving the fix agent more context about what has already been tried
    and what the developer flagged.
- Global reasoning defaults are honored consistently across review, fix, refine,
    and related workflows. Resolution order: explicit CLI flag > per-repo config
    \> global config > default.
- The TUI lets you inspect the full prompt while a job is still queued, before
    it starts running. Press `p` on any queued job that has a stored prompt
    (task, fix, compact, insights).

**Bug fixes**

- `roborev fix` correctly discovers open jobs on the current branch. Previously,
    it could include jobs from unrelated branches or miss jobs when run from
    `main` due to unreachable SHAs from squashed or amended commits.
- Codex sandbox compatibility improvements. A new `disable_codex_sandbox` config
    option bypasses `bwrap` sandboxing on systems where it is unavailable.
    Read-only sandboxed reviews fall back to inline diff snapshots when `.git/`
    is inaccessible to the agent. See
    [Configuration](/docs/configuration/#global-options).
- Codex review jobs now store and display the actual command line used, fixing
    incorrect command reporting in the TUI.
- CI repo matching resolves ambiguous repositories (multiple repos sharing the
    same git identity) by preferring auto-cloned repos instead of failing.
- GitHub Actions release checksums use the expected `SHA256SUMS` filename.

    cascading, review-level filtering, config/worktree/CI reasoning fixes, and

## 0.50

<small>2026-03-31</small>

**New features**

- `auto_close_passing_reviews` config option to automatically close reviews that
    pass with no findings. When enabled, pass reviews are closed immediately
    instead of staying open in the queue. See
    [Configuration](/docs/configuration/#auto-close-passing-reviews).
- Bundled `roborev-refine` skills for Claude Code and Codex to run iterative
    review-fix-review loops from within an agent session. The skill performs the
    full refine workflow inline (review, fix, commit, re-review) rather than
    shelling out to the CLI. See
    [Agent Skills](/docs/guides/agent-skills/#refine-a-branch).
- Bundled systemd service and socket unit files for Linux daemon deployments.
    The service uses `Type=notify` for readiness signaling. Socket activation is
    supported for on-demand daemon startup. See
    [Persistent Daemon](/docs/configuration/#persistent-daemon).

**Improvements**

- The TUI updates instantly by subscribing to the daemon event stream (SSE)
    instead of polling on a timer. Polling is retained as a 15-second fallback.
- CI review prompts now include human PR discussion (issue comments, review
    summaries, and inline review comments) from trusted collaborators with
    maintain or admin access. Discussion is treated as untrusted context with
    safety guardrails.
- The daemon socket path prefers `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/roborev/daemon.sock` when the
    variable is set and points to an existing absolute directory. Falls back to
    the platform temp directory otherwise. See
    [Configuration](/docs/configuration/#unix-domain-socket).

**Bug fixes**

- Preserve the requested model when rerunning reviews. Previously, rerunning a
    review could resolve a different model from config defaults instead of
    preserving the model specified in the original request. A separate
    `requested_model` field now tracks explicit user intent.
- Enforce a `batch_timeout` (default: 3 minutes) on CI PR comment batches to
    prevent indefinite hangs when some jobs in a multi-agent batch get stuck.
    When the timeout expires, available results are posted and remaining jobs
    are canceled. See
    [CI Options Reference](/docs/integrations/github/#ci-options-reference).

**Acknowledgements**

## 0.49

<small>2026-03-24</small>

**New features**

- `roborev insights` command analyzes failing code reviews to identify recurring
    patterns, hotspot areas, noise candidates, and guideline gaps. Outputs
    actionable suggestions for improving `review_guidelines` in `.roborev.toml`.
    Runs as a daemon-backed job, queued and tracked like reviews. See
    [Commands](/docs/commands/#insights).
- Unix domain socket support for CLI-to-daemon communication on Unix systems.
    Set `server_addr = "unix://"` in `~/.roborev/config.toml` to listen on
    `/tmp/roborev-{UID}/daemon.sock` instead of TCP loopback. Socket permissions
    (`0600`) enforce per-user access control. See
    [Configuration](/docs/configuration/#unix-domain-socket).
- `ROBOREV_COLOR_MODE` environment variable to force `auto`, `dark`, `light`, or
    `none` color output across all TUI screens and CLI rendering. See
    [Configuration](/docs/configuration/#color-mode).

**Improvements**

- Skill installation and status reporting use a shared multi-agent catalog.
    `roborev skills` now shows per-agent status (installed, outdated, not
    installed, no agent) for both Claude Code and Codex. Adding future agents
    requires a single catalog entry.
- Large Codex reviews are more reliable. Prompt budgeting is now configurable
    via `max_prompt_size` (per repo) and `default_max_prompt_size` (global),
    with smart fallback instructions that guide Codex to read diffs locally when
    they exceed the prompt budget. Diffs are read in bounded chunks with
    UTF-8-safe truncation.
- Pre-commit auto-fixes and lint hook management now use
    [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) instead of a custom shell script (roborev
    development workflow only).

**Bug fixes**

- `NO_COLOR` is honored on TUI review and prompt detail screens. Previously,
    glamour markdown rendering defaulted to TrueColor regardless of `NO_COLOR`.
- `roborev refine` branch reviews now use the configured review agent instead of
    the fix agent.
- Reviews and hooks for commits made in git worktrees now run in the correct
    worktree directory. A `worktree_path` field is persisted per job so agents
    and hooks operate on the right branch.
- Copilot reviews no longer fail with permission denials in non-interactive
    (daemon) mode. The agent now uses `--allow-all-tools` with a deny-list for
    destructive operations in review mode.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.48

<small>2026-03-18</small>

**Improvements**

- Review agents now run in a read-only sandbox. Codex review jobs use
    `--sandbox read-only` instead of `--full-auto`, matching Claude Code's
    existing read-only tool restrictions. Agentic mode (fix, refine,
    `--agentic`) is unchanged. All agent subprocesses set `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`
    to avoid contending with the user's own git operations.
- `--open` and `--unaddressed` flags on `roborev fix` are deprecated. Open job
    discovery is now the default behavior when no positional job IDs are
    provided. The flags are hidden and silently ignored for backwards
    compatibility.
- `--branch <name>` flag added to `roborev fix` for cross-branch fixing without
    switching branches.
- Skip update notifications in development builds.

**Bug fixes**

- Avoid `.git/index.lock` contention during reviews by setting
    `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` in agent subprocess environments, reducing conflicts
    with concurrent git operations.
- Fix `--all-branches` and `--branch` filtering when running `roborev fix` from
    a git worktree. The branch override was not being threaded through to
    `filterReachableJobs`, causing it to filter by the worktree's branch instead
    of the requested branch.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for
    refactoring worktree helper flows.
- Thanks to [Phillip Cloud](https://github.com/cpcloud) for skipping update
    notifications on dev builds and speeding up the test suite.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.47

<small>2026-03-17</small>

**New features**

- `roborev summary` command shows aggregate review statistics: pass/fail trends,
    per-agent effectiveness, review duration percentiles, fix resolution rates,
    and per-repo breakdowns. Scopes to the current repo by default; use `--all`
    for cross-repo summary. Supports `--since`, `--branch`, `--repo`, and
    `--json` flags. See [Commands](/docs/commands/#review-statistics).
- TUI control socket for programmatic interaction with running TUI instances.
    External tools can query state and trigger mutations (filter, select, close,
    cancel, rerun, quit) over a Unix domain socket using a newline-delimited
    JSON protocol. Runtime metadata is written to `~/.roborev/tui.{PID}.json`
    for discoverability. See
    [TUI Control Socket](/docs/integrations/tui/#control-socket).
- `--no-quit` flag on `roborev tui` suppresses keyboard quit (`q`) in queue and
    tasks views, allowing external controllers to manage the TUI lifecycle. The
    `quit` control command still works regardless.
- Token usage tracking: agent token consumption (peak context tokens and total
    output tokens) is automatically recorded after each job completes and
    displayed in the TUI review header and `roborev show` output. Requires
    `agentsview` to be installed. `roborev backfill-tokens` retroactively
    fetches token data for completed jobs that have session IDs but no stored
    usage.
- `opencode_cmd` config key to override the OpenCode executable path, matching
    the existing pattern for other `*_cmd` overrides.

**Improvements**

- Common lockfiles and generated files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, go.sum,
    Cargo.lock, uv.lock, and others) are excluded from review diffs by default.
    Add custom patterns via `exclude_patterns` in global or per-repo config.
    Security reviews skip repo-level exclude patterns to prevent suppression of
    sensitive files. See [Configuration](/docs/configuration/#exclude-patterns).
- `maximum` reasoning level (aliases: `max`, `xhigh`) maps to Codex's xhigh
    reasoning effort. For agents without an xhigh equivalent, it maps to
    thorough. See [Reasoning Levels](/docs/configuration/#reasoning-levels).
- Session ID column in the TUI queue view.
- Column checkboxes in the TUI options menu respond to mouse clicks.
- Long comment text word-wraps in the TUI review pane.
- The TUI elapsed timer updates every second instead of only on data refreshes.
- Skill names switched from colon syntax (`roborev:fix`) to hyphenated syntax
    (`roborev-fix`) for compatibility with GitHub Copilot CLI. Run
    `roborev skills update` to apply the new names. Both Claude Code and Codex
    skills are updated.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix `GetCurrentBranch` returning a `heads/`-prefixed branch name when git refs
    are ambiguous.
- Update Gemini defaults and fall back cleanly when the configured model is
    unavailable.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Phillip Cloud](https://github.com/cpcloud) for isolating tests from
    global git config, fixing a session-stream test agent leak, adding the TUI

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.46

<small>2026-03-11</small>

**Improvements**

- Agent availability checks now honor `*_cmd` config overrides
    (`claude_code_cmd`, `codex_cmd`, `cursor_cmd`, `pi_cmd`). Previously, custom
    agent commands were ignored during availability detection, so an agent could
    appear unavailable even when the configured binary was in PATH. See
    [Agent Command Overrides](/docs/configuration/#agent-command-overrides).
- The TUI review screen now displays the branch name stored with the review
    instead of resolving it dynamically via `git name-rev`. In worktree setups
    where the same SHA is reachable from multiple refs, the old behavior could
    display the wrong branch.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix the post-commit hook sending the worktree path instead of the main
    repository root to the daemon when running inside a linked git worktree.
    This caused commits to be registered under a phantom repo entry.
- Fix `roborev fix --open`, `--list`, and `--batch` discovering reviews from
    other worktrees. Jobs are now filtered to only those reachable from the
    current worktree's HEAD or matching its branch name.
- Fix the post-commit hook not firing in linked git worktrees when
    `core.hooksPath` is set to a relative path. Relative paths are now resolved
    against the main repository root instead of the worktree root. `init`,
    `install-hook`, and `uninstall-hook` also normalize the hooks path and fail
    early if it cannot be resolved.
- Add JSONL post-commit hook logging to `~/.roborev/post-commit.log` so that
    silent hook failures leave an audit trail with timestamps, repo paths, and
    failure reasons. See
    [Troubleshooting](/docs/guides/troubleshooting/#post-commit-hook-log).

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for fixing
    post-commit hooks in git worktrees and migrating tests to testify.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.45

<small>2026-03-08</small>

**New features**

- `--min-severity` flag for `roborev fix` and `roborev refine` to limit fixes to
    findings at or above a chosen severity (`low`, `medium`, `high`,
    `critical`). Also configurable per repo via `fix_min_severity` and
    `refine_min_severity` in `.roborev.toml`. When all findings in a review fall
    below the threshold, `refine` automatically closes the review instead of
    treating it as a fix failure.
- Experimental: `reuse_review_session` config option (global and per repo) to
    resume prior agent sessions on the same branch, reducing token usage and
    review latency on active branches. See
    [Session Reuse](/docs/guides/reviewing-code/#session-reuse).

**Improvements**

- `roborev show` now displays comments after the review output, matching the TUI
    review detail view.
- Copied reviews (TUI `y` key) now include review comments, giving the fix agent
    more context when you paste into an agent session.
- Agent tool-call narration (text the agent emits before tool calls) is stripped
    from persisted review output across all agents.
- Daemon status details are hidden from the review detail view in the TUI; the
    queue view is unchanged.
- Review prompts now instruct agents not to build projects, run tests, or
    execute code during review.
- `roborev config set` and `roborev init` now produce commented TOML output with
    inline descriptions for each field.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix `roborev compact` using the wrong branch inside git worktrees. It was
    resolving the main checkout's branch instead of the worktree's branch.
- Fix workflow model fallback so it uses the selected agent's actual default
    model instead of the global default.
- Job log files are no longer permanently lost when the initial file open fails
    under resource pressure. The new log writer retries and buffers output until
    disk logging recovers.
- Timed-out review jobs now unwind reliably instead of appearing to run past the
    configured `job_timeout`. Timeout errors are recorded as
    `agent timeout after <duration>` for clearer reporting in the TUI and hooks.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for
    documenting auto-written TOML config files and safely reusing review
    sessions on the current branch.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.44

<small>2026-03-07</small>

**New features**

- `mouse_enabled` global config flag (and TUI options menu toggle) to disable
    mouse interactions in the TUI.
- `roborev post-commit` command and `post_commit_review` repo config to control
    post-commit review behavior, including branch review workflows.
- Webhook review hooks (`type = "webhook"`) for external integrations.
- `excluded_commit_patterns` repo config for skipping reviews based on commit
    message substrings.
- `auto_filter_branch` global config to automatically filter the TUI to the
    current branch or worktree on startup.

**Improvements**

- Tighter review prompts and more consistent verdict parsing.
- Daemon/client mismatch warnings surfaced through daemon status output.

<small>2026-03-06</small>

**New features**

- `default_backup_model` config option to control the fallback model used by
    agent workflows when the primary model is unavailable.
- `advanced.tasks_enabled` config flag to opt in to the TUI background tasks
    workflow (fix jobs, patch application, and rebasing). This workflow was
    previously enabled by default and has been moved behind a flag to avoid
    confusion about the primary review workflow.

**Improvements**

- `Ctrl-D` quits the TUI as an additional shortcut alongside `q`.
- Improved built-in agent skill definitions for more reliable matching, and
    expanded agent configuration documentation.

**Bug fixes**

- Agent resolution for `review`, `analyze`, `fix`, and `refine` commands now
    selects the intended agent more reliably.
- CLI `--agent` overrides no longer inherit the wrong `default_model` from
    configuration.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for Ctrl-D
    TUI quit handling and gating the advanced TUI tasks workflow behind
    configuration.

## 0.42

<small>2026-03-05</small>

**New features**

- Multi-repo workspace support: `roborev list` looks in immediate child
    subfolders for repos, and `roborev review` suggests repo-level review
    commands.
- Cursor agent support.
- Pi coding agent support.
- Save generated patch files to disk from the TUI Tasks view.

**Improvements**

- Skip review throttling when a new push supersedes an in-progress review. The
    old review is canceled and the new one starts immediately.
- Validate configured agent names and reject unknown agents earlier.

**Bug fixes**

- Improve Claude review failure reporting so agent errors are captured and
    surfaced correctly.

**Acknowledgements**

## 0.41

<small>2026-03-04</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Restore a separate `P/F` verdict column in the TUI queue so review outcomes
    are easier to scan.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.40

<small>2026-03-03</small>

**New features**

- ACP (Agent Client Protocol) support: run reviews through any ACP-compatible
    agent via the `[acp]` config section.
- Kiro agent integration via `kiro-cli`.
- Configurable PR comment upsert: update existing roborev PR comments instead of
    posting duplicates (`ci.upsert_comments`).

**Improvements**

- Renamed review status terminology to `closed`/`open` across CLI, TUI, and API.
    `roborev close` and `roborev fix --open` replace the legacy command/flag
    aliases (which are still accepted).
- Combined the separate Status and P/F columns in the TUI queue into a single
    Status column with color-coded states (Queued, Running, Pass, Fail, Error,
    Canceled).
- Column customization in the TUI: press `o` to reorder or toggle column
    visibility. New `column_borders`, `column_order`, and `task_column_order`
    config options.
- Mouse copy/paste in TUI content views; long stderr lines wrap in log views.
- Visual polish across TUI queue, review, and task screens: tighter column
    spacing, box-drawing separators, right-aligned elapsed column.
- Deprecated the `/roborev:address` skill in favor of `/roborev:fix`.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed UTF-8 truncation when composing PR comments.
- Fixed command/footer parsing by trimming trailing blank lines and enforcing
    `--` separators.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Danny Steenman](https://github.com/dannysteenman) for configurable
    PR comment upserts and UTF-8 truncation fixes.

## 0.38

<small>2026-02-26</small>

**New features**

- Kilo agent support via the `kilo` CLI.
- `roborev wait` accepts multiple job IDs in a single command.

**Improvements**

- TUI task view supports mouse interactions (click to select, double-click to
    view).
- `roborev update` manages the daemon lifecycle for smoother upgrades.

**Bug fixes**

- Use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the OpenCode agent in GitHub Actions workflows.
- `roborev fix` skips reviews that already have a `PASS` verdict.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for multiple
    job IDs in `roborev wait`, mouse improvements for TUI tasks, and Kilo agent
    support.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.37

<small>2026-02-25</small>

**Improvements**

- TUI help bar restyled with two-tone key hints and aligned columns for easier
    shortcut scanning.
- Unified stream output formatting across CLI and TUI views for more consistent
    display.

**Bug fixes**

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Miki Tebeka](https://github.com/tebeka) for reporting the correct
    version when roborev is installed with `go install`.
- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for
    restyling the TUI help bar with aligned two-tone keys.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.36

<small>2026-02-24</small>

**New features**

- `roborev tui --repo` and `--branch` flags to launch the TUI pre-filtered to a
    specific repository or branch. Without a value, each flag resolves to the
    current repo/branch. With `=` syntax (e.g. `--repo=/path/to/repo`,
    `--branch=feature-x`), the value is used directly. When set via flags, the
    filter is locked and cannot be changed in the TUI.
- Inline fix panel in the TUI review view: press `F` while viewing a review to
    open a fix prompt at the bottom of the screen instead of a full-screen
    modal. `Tab` toggles focus between the review content and the fix input.
    `Enter` submits, `Esc` cancels.
- Shell completions for `--agent` and `--reasoning` flags across all commands
    that accept them (`init`, `review`, `run`, `fix`, `analyze`, `refine`).
- OpenCode JSON stream support: the OpenCode agent now uses `--format json` for
    structured JSONL output, integrated into the unified stream formatter for
    consistent progress rendering.
- CI repository matching with wildcard patterns and exclusion lists. `ci.repos`
    entries now support glob patterns (e.g. `"myorg/*"`, `"myorg/api-*"`) using
    `path.Match` syntax. New `exclude_repos` field filters out matching repos,
    and `max_repos` (default: 100) caps the total expanded count. Wildcard
    results are cached for one hour.

**Improvements**

- TUI help bar uses table-based rendering for consistent column alignment across
    all views.

**Bug fixes**

- `--all-branches` now implies `--open` on `roborev fix` and `roborev refine`,
    removing the need to pass both flags.
- Patch application in git worktrees resolves the correct worktree path via
    `git worktree list`, fixing failures when the branch is checked out in a
    non-default worktree location.
- Temporary command execution uses explicit file sync and retry with exponential
    backoff to prevent intermittent `text file busy` (ETXTBSY) races on Linux.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for TUI
    repo/branch flags, help bar alignment, temp-command race fixes, shell
    completions, worktree patch-path handling, and the inline fix panel.

    wildcard patterns and exclusion lists.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.35

<small>2026-02-23</small>

**New features**

- Shell completion for `roborev analyze` command types: tab-complete analysis
    type names (e.g. `roborev analyze <TAB>` suggests `refactor`, `complexity`,
    etc.).
- Persistent job logs: agent output is written to `~/.roborev/logs/jobs/` as
    NDJSON so review activity survives daemon restarts.
- Unified log viewer: `roborev log <job-id>` renders stored job output on the
    CLI, and pressing `l` in the TUI opens a scrollable log viewer with live
    polling for running jobs. `roborev log clean` removes old log files.

**Improvements**

- Test and production runtime data are isolated so `go test` runs do not pollute
    `~/.roborev/` logs or interfere with the production daemon.
- CLI and TUI streaming output uses gutter-grouped tool calls, markdown text
    wrapping, and Codex reasoning item rendering for clearer review progress.

**Bug fixes**

- Handle empty Git refs when fixing compact review jobs to prevent fix-flow
    failures. The server resolves a usable ref from the parent job's branch or
    falls back to HEAD, and the TUI shows a confirmation modal when no ref is
    available.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for analyze
    command shell completions and compact-review fix handling for empty git
    refs.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.34

<small>2026-02-22</small>

**New features**

- `roborev ci review`: daemon-free batch reviews for CI pipelines with
    auto-detection of GitHub Actions environment variables (`GITHUB_REPOSITORY`,
    `GITHUB_REF`, `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`).
- `roborev init gh-action`: generates a GitHub Actions workflow file with
    SHA256-verified roborev installation and agent setup.
- TUI fix jobs: press `F` on a completed review to launch a background fix in an
    isolated worktree. New Tasks view (`T`) for managing fix jobs and applying
    patches.
- CI poller auto-clone: repos in `ci.repos` no longer require a local
    `roborev init` checkout. The poller clones them automatically to
    `~/.roborev/clones/`.
- Quota-aware agent cooldown: agents that hit hard quota limits enter a timed
    cooldown (default 30 min) with automatic failover to backup agents. CI
    comments show "skipped (quota)" instead of "failed".
- Daemon activity logging for better operational visibility.

**Improvements**

- Review verdicts are stored for reuse in later review workflows.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix jobs now create worktrees at the reviewed commit instead of HEAD,
    preventing patches against the wrong revision.
- Database migration no longer crashes on databases with quoted table names from
    prior ALTER TABLE migrations.
- Missing git origin remote treated as confirmed mismatch for auto-clone instead
    of a transient error.
- Fixed a data race between `WorkerPool.Start` and `WorkerPool.Stop`.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Hugh Brown](https://github.com/hughdbrown) for storing verdicts for
    later use.

## 0.33

<small>2026-02-17</small>

**New features**

- `roborev compact` command to verify and consolidate open review findings,
    reducing false positives and merging related findings from multiple reviews
    into a single consolidated review.
- Backup-agent failover: automatically retry failed jobs with a secondary agent
    when the primary fails (e.g. fall back to Claude Code when Codex
    rate-limits).
- GitHub commit status checks: the CI poller posts pending/success/failure
    statuses on PR commits when GitHub App auth is configured.
- Ref-aware configuration: the CI poller reads `.roborev.toml` from the PR
    branch's git ref, so configuration can vary by branch.
- `--label` flag on `roborev run` for custom labels displayed in the TUI.

**Improvements**

- Consolidated review guidelines for more consistent review output across
    commands.
- Hardened CI and hook workflows for more reliable automated runs.

**Bug fixes**

- Post-rewrite hook preserves review history across rebases by remapping commit
    SHAs when patch content is unchanged.
- Skip hook upgrade checks in CI mode to avoid CI interruptions.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed TUI Cursor cancel behavior and corrected closed/open stats display.
- Fixed agent prompt handling on Windows to avoid the 32KB command-line limit.
- Fixed refine loops so git hook failures no longer break execution.
