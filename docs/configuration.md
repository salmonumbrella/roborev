title: Configuration
description: Configure roborev behavior globally and per-repository
---

roborev uses a layered configuration system. Settings are resolved in this order
(highest to lowest priority):

1. **CLI flags** (`--agent`, `--model`, `--reasoning`)
1. **Experiment overlay** for an enrolled review
1. **Per-repo** `.roborev.toml` in your repository root
1. **Project defaults** in global `projects` tables, matched by Git remote
1. **Global** `~/.roborev/config.toml`
1. **Defaults** (auto-detect agent, thorough reasoning for reviews)

## Budget-aware agent routing

A global soft daily budget can route fresh daemon jobs to cheaper agents as
recorded spend rises. Routing is disabled by default. Add this to your global
`~/.roborev/config.toml`:

```toml
[budget]
enabled = true
daily_limit_cents = 500
reserve_floor_cents = 100

[budget.agent_costs]
claude-code = 15
codex = 12
gemini = 5
```

Prices are positive integer estimates of cents per job. Only listed, installed
agents participate; command overrides and named ACP agents are supported. If the
configured agent has no listed price, it keeps ordinary routing, even at the
cap: the daemon cannot compare its cost with the candidates. Candidates for
custom review types must support structured review output. Quote ACP identities
in TOML, for example `"acp.reviewer" = 5`. Aliases are accepted, but listing two
names for the same agent is an error. The daily limit must be positive when
enabled, and the reserve must be between zero and the limit.

Below `daily_limit_cents - reserve_floor_cents`, the configured agent runs. At
that threshold, candidates are scored by quality divided by estimated cost: the
configured agent gets weight 2 and alternatives get weight 1. At or above the
daily limit, the cheapest available candidate runs. Ties prefer the configured
agent, then alphabetical agent name. Agents in quota cooldown are excluded. The
reserve uses the same weights throughout; scoring does not change gradually as
spend approaches the cap. The cap never stops jobs; missing cost data,
unavailable candidates, or a spend-query error preserve ordinary agent
resolution and quota failover.

If repository config cannot be read, jobs with stored prompts skip budget
substitution and use ordinary agent resolution. Budget routing does not make
repository config mandatory for these jobs.

Spend uses recorded costs on currently retained terminal job rows completed
within the UTC calendar day, across all repositories. With PostgreSQL sync, this
includes other machines' jobs once their costs arrive through sync; it is not a
per-machine budget. Failed, canceled and skipped jobs contribute when their cost
was captured or backfilled. Jobs with neither an agent invocation nor recorded
usage are excluded. Unpriced jobs are unknown rather than free, so measured
spend may understate usage. Rerunning, retrying, or failing over a job replaces
its previous attempt telemetry and can reduce measured spend. This is an
approximate routing budget, not an accounting ledger. Agent prices remain static
estimates; they are not learned from historical costs.

Fresh review, range, dirty, task/analysis, insights, compact and background fix
jobs can be routed, including jobs with an explicit `--agent`. Explicit
model/provider requests, nonempty sessions (including automatic session reuse),
panel/CI execution choices, requests using the offline `test` agent, frozen
experiment assignments, retries, quota failover, classification and synthesis
preserve their selected execution contract. Their recorded costs still
contribute to spend. Substitutions use the new adapter's default model and
provider, or a model explicitly paired with the configured backup. When routing
selects that backup, the original agent becomes the failover target for this
attempt. A manual rerun on this daemon restores the pre-budget agent and backup
settings, resolves its model again, and applies the current budget. Selecting an
agent explicitly for the rerun replaces that original choice. The routing lock
and original choices are local scheduling state and are not synced to other
machines.

The daemon applies config reloads to subsequent job decisions. Spend is cached
for up to 10 seconds, refreshes at UTC midnight, and is invalidated when this
worker pool records a completed job or new cost data, or the daemon accepts a
manual rerun. Concurrent jobs may start before another job's cost is available.

You can edit individual prices through the CLI:

```bash
roborev config set budget.daily_limit_cents 500 --global
roborev config set budget.agent_costs.codex 12 --global
roborev config get budget.agent_costs.codex --global
roborev config set budget.enabled true --global
roborev config set budget.agent_costs.codex '' --global  # remove a candidate
```

## The `config` Command

The `roborev config` command lets you inspect and modify configuration from the
command line, similar to `git config`. It works with both global and per-repo
config files.

### Get a value

```bash
roborev config get default_agent              # merged: tries local, then global
roborev config get default_agent --global     # global config only
roborev config get review_agent --local       # repo config only
roborev config get sync.enabled               # nested keys use dot notation
```

Without `--global` or `--local`, `get` uses merged scope: it checks the repo
config first, then falls back to global. The raw value is printed to stdout for
easy piping, except `auth_key`, which is masked.

### Set a value

```bash
roborev config set default_agent codex --global
roborev config set max_workers 8 --global
roborev config set review_agent claude-code    # defaults to --local
roborev config set sync.enabled true --global
roborev config set ci.repos "org/repo1,org/repo2" --global
```

Without `--global` or `--local`, `set` defaults to writing the repo config
(`.roborev.toml`). You must be inside a git repository for local writes.

Values are automatically coerced to the correct type:

| Config type | Input format | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| string | as-is | `codex` |
| integer | decimal number | `8` |
| boolean | true/false, 1/0 | `true` |
| string array | comma-separated | `"org/repo1,org/repo2"` |

Writes are atomic (temp file + rename) and preserve file permissions: `0600` for
global config (which may contain secrets) and `0644` for repo config.

!!! note

    Some keys are scoped to one file. For example, `server_addr` is global-only and
    cannot be set with `--local`. The command will tell you if a key doesn't belong
    in the scope you chose.

### List all values

```bash
roborev config list                    # merged config (effective values)
roborev config list --global           # global config only
roborev config list --local            # repo config only
roborev config list --show-origin      # show where each value comes from
```

The `--show-origin` flag adds a column showing whether each value comes from
`global`, `local`, or `default`:

```
global  default_agent   codex
local   review_agent    claude-code
default max_workers     4
```

Sensitive values (API keys, database URLs) are automatically masked in list
output, showing only the last 4 characters.

### Validate configuration

```bash
roborev config validate              # merged global and repo configuration
roborev config validate --global     # global configuration only
roborev config validate --local      # repo configuration only
```

Validation checks ordinary configuration values and materializes experiment
overlays before any review is queued. The merged command also checks repository
enablement overrides against their global experiment definitions. All complete
experiment definitions are checked, including disabled experiments, so a new
definition can be validated before it is enabled.

## Project Defaults by Git Remote

To use a different review model or reasoning level for selected projects without
editing each checkout, add project tables to `~/.roborev/config.toml`:

```toml
review_model = "gpt-5.6-luna"

[projects."github.com/example/project-a"]
review_model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
review_reasoning = "medium"
display_name = "Project A"

[projects."github.com/example/project-b"]
review_model = "gpt-6-astra"
display_name = "Project B"
```

Edit these tables directly in TOML; `config set` does not traverse project map
entries. Put top-level settings before the tables, as required by TOML.

The table key is `host/owner/repository`, without a URL scheme, SSH username, or
`.git` suffix. Matching uses `origin`, falling back to another remote when there
is no origin. SSH and HTTPS URLs match the same key. Hostnames are lowercase;
repository paths are case-sensitive. For example,
`git@github.com:example/project-a.git` and
`https://github.com/example/project-a.git` both match the first entry above.
Repositories with only local-path remotes do not match these tables.

Every checkout with that remote receives the same project settings, including
linked worktrees created from a bare repository. Matching does not depend on the
checkout directory name, branch name, or `.roborev-id`. The optional
`display_name` groups these checkouts under one project name in the TUI and its
repository filter. An explicit repository `display_name` takes precedence.

By default, project `review_model` applies to ordinary reviews at every
reasoning level, including reviews from hooks and default-type panel/CI members
that inherit a model. CLI models, experiment overrides, repository models, and
explicit panel member models keep their priority. The project model takes
precedence over global `review_model_<level>`, `review_model`, and
`default_model`. Unmatched projects keep the general global defaults. Other
standalone workflows (such as fix, security, and design) retain their existing
settings.

Project `review_reasoning` supplies a default for reviews, including `--local`
and CI. CLI reasoning, repository settings, experiment overrides, custom review
type reasoning, and pinned panel member reasoning keep their priority. It takes
precedence over general global review reasoning. CI retains its existing
`thorough` default for unmatched projects. Both exact effort names (`low`,
`medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`) and legacy levels (`fast`, `standard`,
`thorough`, `maximum`) are accepted. The effective reasoning level also selects
reasoning-specific model settings when no model is pinned.

### Overriding Panel Models

A panel can pin a model on each member, so changing `default_model` or a project
default alone will not change those members. To use a different model for all
primary reviewers of selected projects, explicitly enable the override:

```toml
[projects."github.com/example/project-a"]
review_model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
override_panel_models = true
synthesis_model = "gpt-6-astra" # Optional, independent synthesis override
review_reasoning = "medium"
override_panel_reasoning = true
synthesis_reasoning = "medium" # Optional, independent synthesis override
```

`override_panel_models = true` makes the project `review_model` take precedence
over individual panel member models and workflow defaults, including member
models supplied by repository configuration or experiments. It applies to every
review type, including security, design, and custom types, in both local and CI
panels. The daemon CI poller's review matrices and automatically added design
members follow the same policy. Enabling it without a nonempty project
`review_model` is an error.

The separate project `synthesis_model`, when set, overrides a panel's explicit
`synthesis_model` or the CI synthesis setting. It does not require
`override_panel_models`. When omitted, synthesis keeps its existing resolution;
changing reviewer models alone does not change synthesis.

Daemon-free `roborev ci review` also honors the project `synthesis_model`, ahead
of global `[ci].synthesis_model`, in GitHub and GitLab CI runs. If neither is
set, it leaves synthesis model selection to the agent.

`override_panel_reasoning = true` similarly forces the project
`review_reasoning` across panel members of every type, including pinned member
reasoning, CI matrices, and automatically added CI design reviews. It requires a
nonempty project `review_reasoning`. Explicit CLI reasoning keeps priority in
daemon-free CI reviews.

Project `synthesis_reasoning` independently overrides panel and CI synthesis
reasoning, including a panel's own `synthesis_reasoning` and daemon-free
`roborev ci review`. It does not require `override_panel_reasoning`. When
omitted, synthesis keeps its existing reasoning selection.

These settings change models and reasoning, not agents or providers. Use a model
accepted by each affected agent when overriding a mixed-agent panel. Backup
models retain their existing failover behavior. Settings for other projects are
unaffected.

## Daemon authentication

Set a shared key in the daemon owner's global config to require authentication
for all native daemon APIs, including reads, shutdown, streaming, profiling, MCP
and the OpenAPI document. Authentication is disabled when `auth_key` is empty
(the default). This key is global-only; repo config cannot override it.

Generate a fresh 32-byte key with:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Put its 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters in `~/.roborev/config.toml`:

```toml
auth_key = "<paste-the-generated-value-here>"
```

Nonempty keys must use this format. Short keys and other encodings are rejected.
Generate a new key rather than padding or repeating a password to fit the
required length; format validation cannot verify randomness.

Keep this file readable only by the account that owns the daemon
(`chmod 600 ~/.roborev/config.toml` on Unix). Roborev's global config writes use
`0600`. `roborev config get auth_key --global` and config lists mask the key.
Invalid keys or malformed config prevent daemon startup. An explicitly supplied
`daemon run --config` path must exist.

The CLI, hooks and TUI read the key from their global config automatically,
including for `--server` and Unix sockets. To allow a different account, give it
the same `auth_key` in its own global config. When the daemon uses a custom
`--config` file, configure the matching key in each client's usual global config
too. `ROBOREV_DATA_DIR` changes the global config directory as usual. The key is
not published in daemon runtime files.

If posting a fix comment or enqueueing its follow-up review returns HTTP 401,
the CLI reports access denied and directs you to check `auth_key` in the global
config. It does not retry the write or start daemon recovery.

The browser UI requires this key at login when no explicit `[web]` token or
trusted proxy authentication is configured. An explicit browser token remains an
independent login credential. When `auth_key` is enabled with proxy mode, the
reverse proxy must supply `Authorization: Bearer <key>` to the backend
`/api/ui/session` endpoints (below `web.base_path`, if configured). Forwarding
headers alone cannot authenticate the proxy on a shared host. Browser
authentication keeps its existing session, origin and CSRF checks.

Auth changes require a daemon restart. Stop the daemon while the old key is
still configured, update the key in the daemon and client config files, then
start it again:

```bash
roborev daemon stop
# Edit auth_key in the daemon and client global config files.
roborev daemon start
```

If a TCP daemon is still running after you add `auth_key`, use
`roborev daemon restart`. The CLI verifies the local runtime and endpoint before
sending a shutdown request without the new key. If the TCP endpoint is occupied
but its daemon identity cannot be verified, the CLI refuses to start another
daemon.

When upgrading from a pre-TLS release with `auth_key` already enabled on TCP,
`roborev daemon restart` cannot stop the existing process: its runtime record
has no TLS certificate pin, and the old daemon rejects the keyless shutdown
request. Stop it through its service manager or stop the recorded PID manually,
then start the daemon again. The CLI will not send the key over plaintext.

For a service-managed daemon, stop the service, update the configs, then start
the service. Editing or deleting config while the daemon is running does not
change its active key. Existing CLI/TUI HTTP clients reread their config for
later requests, so they use the updated key after restart. If discovery failed
before a client selected a daemon, restart that client after correcting its
config so it can discover the endpoint again.

Daemon HTTP clients validate `auth_key` separately from other settings. An
unrelated invalid setting does not prevent them from using a valid key.
Malformed TOML or an invalid `auth_key` prevents requests from being sent.

MCP installers do not configure HTTP authentication headers. Use the default
stdio transport when `auth_key` is set; see
[MCP Server](/docs/integrations/mcp/).

Custom API clients send the key in an HTTP header:

```bash
curl --cacert "$ROBOREV_DAEMON_CERT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ROBOREV_AUTH_KEY" \
  https://127.0.0.1:7373/api/status
```

`ROBOREV_AUTH_KEY` and `ROBOREV_DAEMON_CERT` above are shell variables for curl,
not roborev config overrides. Set the certificate variable to a PEM file
containing the `tls_certificate` from the daemon's protected runtime record. The
certificate is public; the runtime record does not contain the private key or
`auth_key`. Missing or incorrect credentials return HTTP 401. Query-string keys
are not accepted. Native clients discover and trust the runtime certificate
automatically. Go consumers can pass an `http.Client` configured to trust that
certificate to `client.NewWithAuthKeyAndHTTPClient`.

When `auth_key` is set on a TCP listener, native API traffic uses TLS and
clients verify the daemon certificate before sending the key. TCP listeners
remain loopback-only. With no key, TCP continues to use HTTP. Unix sockets use
their filesystem permissions and do not use TLS. Native clients refresh the
certificate pin from the matching live runtime record on each new TLS
connection, so polling clients can reconnect after the daemon restarts.
Authenticated TCP startup fails if the daemon cannot publish its certificate in
the runtime record, so clients do not try to send the key without a pin.

The browser UI runs on a separate loopback HTTP listener. Its login credentials,
including the shared key, browser token, or key supplied by a trusted proxy,
travel over that connection. An active local TCP impersonator could capture
them. Use an HTTPS reverse proxy for remote browser access and keep its backend
on the trusted host. This does not isolate processes that already run as the
daemon owner's account or can read its config.

## Per-Repository Configuration

Create `.roborev.toml` in your repository root to customize behavior for that
project.

```toml
agent = "gemini"                  # AI agent to use
model = "gemini-3-flash-preview"  # Model override for this repo
review_context_count = 5   # Recent reviews to include as context
display_name = "backend"   # Custom name shown in TUI (optional)
excluded_branches = ["wip", "scratch"]  # Branches to skip reviews on
excluded_branch_patterns = ["worktree-agent-*", "release/*"]  # Branch globs to skip for automatic post-commit reviews

# Legacy levels: fast, standard, thorough, maximum
# Exact agent efforts: low, medium, high, xhigh, max
review_reasoning = "thorough"  # For code reviews (default: thorough)
refine_reasoning = "standard"  # For refine command (default: standard)

# Severity filtering
review_min_severity = "medium"  # Low findings are reported but do not fail reviews
fix_min_severity = "medium"     # Skip low-severity findings in fix
refine_min_severity = "medium"  # Skip low-severity findings in refine

# Session reuse (experimental)
reuse_review_session = true     # Resume prior agent sessions on same branch

# Auto-close passing reviews
auto_close_passing_reviews = true

# Project-specific review guidelines
review_guidelines = """
No database migrations needed - no production databases yet.
Prefer composition over inheritance.
All public APIs must have documentation comments.
"""

[kata_context]
mode = "current"   # off (default), current, or open
max_chars = 50000
```

### Fix Commit Metadata

Use `fix_commit_author` and `fix_commit_co_authored_by` to set author metadata
on commits produced by fix-like workflows:

```toml
# .roborev.toml or ~/.roborev/config.toml
fix_commit_author = "Your Name <you@example.com>"
fix_commit_co_authored_by = [
  "Pair Reviewer <pair@example.com>",
]
```

Both keys are accepted in global and per-repo config. Repo config overrides
global config independently per field, so a repo can override only the author
and still inherit global co-authors. Set `fix_commit_author = ""` or
`fix_commit_co_authored_by = []` in `.roborev.toml` to suppress a global value
for that repo.

The identity format must be `Name <email>`. roborev validates this before
invoking Git so bare names fail with a config error instead of Git interpreting
them as commit search patterns.

roborev applies these values directly when it owns the commit:

- `roborev refine` commits
- background fix patches applied from the TUI

For foreground `roborev fix`, `roborev analyze --fix`, and batch fix flows, the
agent creates the commit. roborev adds the configured author and trailer request
to the agent prompt, but this is best-effort. It cannot remove trailers that the
agent adds from its own Git configuration, so duplicate or unexpected
`Co-authored-by` lines can still appear in agent-authored commits. Use `refine`
or TUI-applied background fixes when deterministic trailers matter.

Only the commit author is overridden. The committer remains the user and
environment running `roborev`.

`fix_commit_co_authored_by` uses `git commit --trailer`, which requires Git 2.32
or newer. `fix_commit_author` uses Git's long-standing `--author` option and is
not gated on trailer support.

### Fix Guidelines

Use the global-only `fix_guidelines` setting to tell Agent Hook and foreground
`roborev fix` agents how to evaluate review findings instead of blindly applying
every suggestion:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
fix_guidelines = """
Treat review findings as hypotheses. Verify each one against the code and
project requirements. Explain findings that are intentionally not applied.
"""
```

The value applies to direct fixes, batch fixes, and commit retries. It also
appears at the end of triggered reminders for every Agent Hook profile. Missing
or empty guidance preserves the existing automatic behavior. With guidance
configured, direct `roborev fix` runs record whether changes were applied and
preserve the agent's final explanation before closing each review. Batch runs
record a neutral batch outcome, while the agent report gives every job ID a
fixed or skipped disposition.

This key is not accepted in `.roborev.toml` and has no CLI or environment
override. Agent Hook's `--config` option still controls profile thresholds and
the full-replacement `instruction`, but it does not redirect `fix_guidelines`
away from the standard global config. `roborev analyze --fix` and
`roborev refine` keep their existing, separate prompt behavior.

### Review Guidelines

Use `review_guidelines` to give the AI reviewer persistent context: suppress
irrelevant warnings, enforce conventions, or describe trust boundaries and
architecture so the reviewer doesn't flag non-issues. Guidelines can be global,
per-repo, or both:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
review_guidelines = """
These rules apply to every repository on this machine.
Prefer clear error messages and avoid speculative findings.
"""
```

```toml
# .roborev.toml
review_guidelines = """
This is a local CLI tool. The daemon runs on localhost and all
displayed data originates from the user's own filesystem and git
repos. Do not flag injection or sanitization for data that never
crosses a trust boundary.

Performance is critical - flag any O(n^2) or worse algorithms.
All error messages must be user-friendly.
"""

# Optional: replace global review_guidelines for this repo instead of appending.
review_guidelines_supersede_global = false
```

When both scopes are configured, global guidelines are rendered first and repo
guidelines are appended after them. Set
`review_guidelines_supersede_global = true` in `.roborev.toml` when a repo needs
to replace the global rules entirely.

[Agent Hook](agent-hook.md#review-guidelines-are-required) sends reminders only
in repos with their own guidance: repo `review_guidelines` or `REVIEW.md`.
Global guidelines alone do not enable it.

#### REVIEW.md

When `.roborev.toml` leaves `review_guidelines` empty or unset, roborev falls
back to a `REVIEW.md` file at the repo root — the same file Claude Code's Code
Review auto-discovers, so one committed file can drive both reviewers:

```markdown
# Review instructions

Performance is critical - flag any O(n^2) or worse algorithms.
Do not flag sanitization for data that never crosses a trust boundary.
```

Non-empty `review_guidelines` always wins. Empty values are treated as unset for
compatibility with config files generated by older roborev versions; set
`review_md_fallback = false` for an explicit opt-out. `REVIEW.md` merges with
global guidelines exactly like repo guidelines do — including
`review_guidelines_supersede_global`. Like `.roborev.toml`, `REVIEW.md` is read
from the repo's default branch for commit and range reviews, so a pull request
cannot change the instructions its own review runs under. Dirty (uncommitted)
reviews, local `roborev run` prompts, and repos with no resolvable default
branch read the working-tree copy instead.

An unparseable `.roborev.toml` on the default branch suppresses `REVIEW.md` too
— roborev cannot tell what the repo intended, so those reviews drop the repo
layer entirely rather than run on part of it, and log the parse error. Global
guidelines still apply. Reviews that read the working-tree copy are unaffected
and still fall back to `REVIEW.md`.

Guidelines are included in the review prompt for local and daemon review jobs,
so they shape what the reviewer flags and what it ignores. Common uses:

- **Trust boundaries**: Describe where untrusted data enters the system so the
    reviewer doesn't flag sanitization for trusted paths.
- **Architecture constraints**: Note that the daemon and client evolve in
    lockstep, that backward compatibility isn't required, etc.
- **Suppress noise**: Tell the reviewer to skip narrow-terminal overflow,
    localhost rate-limiting, or other non-issues for your project.

### Make roborev always flag something

Use `review_guidelines` in `.roborev.toml` to inject standing instructions into
every review for the repo:

```toml
review_guidelines = """
Every change to UI components must include or update a Playwright e2e test.
Flag any PR that changes UI without a corresponding e2e test.
"""
```

Because empty hooks are omitted from the generated config, you can add a
`[[hooks]]` block directly without removing anything:

```toml
[[hooks]]
event = "review.*"
type = "kata"
project = "myproj"
```

### Kata Integration

If your repo is bound to a [Kata](https://github.com/kenn-io/kata) project with
a committed `.kata.toml`, roborev can include Kata task context in review
prompts. For an overview of both directions of the integration, see
[Kata](/docs/integrations/kata/).

```toml
# .roborev.toml or ~/.roborev/config.toml
[kata_context]
mode = "current"   # off (default), current, or open
max_chars = 50000  # cap on Kata context bytes in the prompt
```

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `off` | Do not include Kata context (default) |
| `current` | Include only Kata issues referenced in the reviewed commit messages, such as `Closes: kata#abc4` or `<project>#abc4` |
| `open` | Include all open Kata issues from the bound project, excluding issues filed by roborev itself |

`current` mode frames referenced issues as authoritative task intent. `open`
mode frames the open backlog as background context so the reviewer does not
treat every open issue as part of the current change. Dirty reviews have no
commit messages to inspect, so `current` mode includes no Kata context for them;
use `open` if you want dirty reviews to see the backlog.

Kata context applies to local review prompts only (single commit, branch ranges,
and dirty reviews). Daemon CI pull-request reviews never include Kata context,
since PR head content is untrusted and backlog details could leak into public PR
comments. Fix and task jobs do not receive Kata context either.

The `kata` CLI must be on `PATH`. If the CLI is missing or the repo is not bound
to Kata, roborev skips the context without failing the review. If a binding
exists but is broken, or a referenced issue cannot be loaded, the daemon logs
the error and includes a note in the prompt when useful.

Kata context is optional prompt context. If the prompt exceeds
`max_prompt_size`, roborev trims other optional context first and drops Kata
context last.

To file failed reviews and review findings back into Kata, configure a
`type = "kata"` review hook. See
[Built-in: Kata Integration](/docs/guides/hooks/#built-in-kata-integration).

### Workflow-Specific Agent and Model

Use different agents or models depending on the workflow and reasoning level:

```toml
# Use a faster model for quick reviews, thorough model for deep analysis
review_model = "claude"
review_model_fast = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
review_model_thorough = "claude-opus-4-5-20251101"

# Use different agents and models for refine
refine_agent_fast = "gemini"
refine_model_fast = "gemini-3-flash"
refine_agent_thorough = "codex"
refine_model_thorough = "gpt-5.5"
```

Base keys use the pattern `{workflow}_agent` and `{workflow}_model` (e.g.
`review_model`, `refine_agent`, `fix_agent`, `security_agent`, `design_model`)
to set the default for each workflow. Level-specific keys override for a given
reasoning level:

- `{workflow}_model_{level}` or `{workflow}_agent_{level}`
- `workflow` is `review`, `refine`, `fix`, `security`, or `design`
- `level` is a legacy or exact value from [Reasoning Levels](#reasoning-levels)

For compatibility, exact `low`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` routing falls back to
the corresponding `fast`, `thorough`, or `maximum` key when an exact key is not
configured.

Agent and model keys fall back independently. Use the same naming family for
both halves of a level-specific route: keep an existing legacy pair together, or
migrate both keys to exact names. For example, do not combine `review_agent_low`
with `review_model_fast`; the model fallback could pass the legacy route's model
to the exact route's agent. Prefer this form for new configuration:

```toml
review_agent_low = "codex"
review_model_low = "gpt-5.6-terra"
```

The fallback hierarchy for each workflow is:

- **CLI flag** > **repo `{workflow}_agent_{level}`** > **repo
    `{workflow}_agent`** > **repo `agent`** > **global
    `{workflow}_agent_{level}`** > **global `{workflow}_agent`** > **global
    `default_agent`** > `codex`

#### Per-type `[analyze.<type>]` override

Some review types have no dedicated `{type}_agent` / `{type}_model` keys. Those
can be pinned through a generic per-type block keyed by the type name, which
sets `agent` and `model`. Today this applies to the `lookahead` review type:

```toml
[analyze.lookahead]
agent = "claude-code"
model = "sonnet"
```

For such a review type the fallback hierarchy is:

- **CLI flag** > **repo `[analyze.<type>]`** > **repo `agent` / `model`** >
    **global `[analyze.<type>]`** > **global `default_agent` / `default_model`**
    \> `codex` for agent selection, or the agent's own default model

This block is consulted **only** for review types that lack dedicated fields.
Types that have them — `review`, `refine`, `fix`, `security`, `design` — ignore
`[analyze.<type>]` when running reviews and use their `{type}_agent` /
`{type}_model` keys instead. So an `[analyze.security]` table written for
`roborev analyze security` never changes `roborev review --type security`.
Reasoning is unaffected by this block for reviews; it follows `review_reasoning`
(the block's `reasoning` field applies only to `roborev analyze <type>` runs).

### Custom Review Types

Custom domain-specific review types are configured under
`[review.types.<name>]`. They support a Go template, named file includes, and
optional agent, model, and reasoning overrides. See
[Custom Review Types](/docs/advanced/custom-review-types/) for path rules,
template values, structured output, and examples.

### Review Panels

Use `[review]` to configure subagent review panels. A panel fans one daemon
review target out to named reviewers and stores one synthesis parent review:

```toml
[review]
default_panel = "branch_final"
hook_review_panel = "quick"

[review.subagents.bug]
agent = "codex"
review_type = "default"
instructions = "Focus on correctness, regressions, and missing tests."

[review.subagents.security]
agent = "claude-code"
review_type = "security"
allow_failure = true
timeout = "3m"

[review.panels.branch_final]
members = ["bug", "security"]
synthesis_agent = "codex"
```

`default_panel` applies to manual daemon reviews when `--panel` is not set.
`hook_review_panel` applies to automatic post-commit reviews. CI reviews can
select a named panel with `[ci] panel = "branch_final"`. Use
`allow_failure = true` for flaky or best-effort subagents whose failure should
not fail an otherwise successful panel. Use `non_voting = true` to trial a new
agent or model: the member runs and stores its review, but it is excluded from
synthesis and the panel verdict.

Global and repo panel maps are merged by name, with repo entries overriding
global entries. See
[Subagent Review Panels](/docs/advanced/subagent-review-panels/) for the full
reference.

### Review configuration experiments

Use a named experiment to compare the normal review configuration with one
configuration overlay. Roborev deterministically assigns a repository-scoped
source branch to the default or experimental arm, so new commits on that branch
stay in the same arm.

```toml
[experiments.review-session-resumption-v1]
enabled = true
ratio = 0.5
workflows = ["review", "ci"]

[experiments.review-session-resumption-v1.config]
reuse_review_session = true
```

`ratio` is the fraction assigned to the experimental arm and must be between
`0.0` and `1.0`. The default arm uses the normal resolved configuration. The
experimental arm recursively merges `config` above global and repository
configuration but below explicit CLI or request values. Scalars and arrays
replace base values; nested tables merge.

The supported workflows are:

- `review`: daemon-backed user and post-commit reviews, including panels
- `ci`: GitHub CI-poller panel reviews

Reviews without a source branch do not participate. A panel receives one
assignment for the entire run; its members and synthesis share the attribution.
The daemon-free `roborev ci review` command does not participate.

Only settings frozen into the review plan are accepted in an overlay. These
include agents, models, backup agents, reasoning, review severity, session
reuse, review panels, and the CI review matrix. Prompt-building and daemon
runtime settings are rejected because workers resolve those after enqueue.
Database, sync, credential, hook, browser, and comment-posting settings are also
rejected.

An experiment ID is immutable. To change its ratio, workflows, or overlay,
create a new versioned ID. A repository can enable or disable a definition from
global config by overriding only `enabled`:

```toml
# .roborev.toml
[experiments.review-session-resumption-v1]
enabled = false
```

At most one enabled experiment may apply to a workflow. Disabled experiments do
not record assignments.

Review, CI metrics, and CI cost exports include an `experiments` field. It is an
array of assignments when an experiment applies and `null` otherwise. Each
assignment records the experiment ID, arm, subject hash, definition hash, and
effective configuration hash. Use these fields to group outcomes by experiment
and arm. See [Exporting Reviews](/docs/commands/#exporting-reviews),
[Exporting CI Metrics](/docs/commands/#exporting-ci-metrics), and
[Exporting CI Costs](/docs/commands/#exporting-ci-costs).

### Backup Agents

If the primary agent is unavailable (for example, its command is not visible to
the daemon) or fails during execution (rate limits, network errors, crashes),
roborev can use a configured backup agent. This is useful when your primary
agent has usage caps. For example, Codex plans often hit rate limits during
heavy review sessions, so falling back to Claude Code keeps reviews flowing.

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
default_agent = "codex"
default_backup_agent = "claude-code"  # Fallback for any workflow
default_backup_model = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"  # Model paired with default_backup_agent
```

When `default_backup_agent` takes over, it uses the model paired with it in
`default_backup_model`. Without this setting, the backup agent uses its normal
configured model. This is useful when your backup agent needs a different model
than `default_model`, which is typically chosen for the primary agent.

You can also set backup agents per workflow:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
review_backup_agent = "claude-code"   # Fallback for reviews
refine_backup_agent = "codex"         # Fallback for refine
fix_backup_agent = "claude-code"      # Fallback for fix
```

Per-repo overrides work the same way in `.roborev.toml`:

```toml
# .roborev.toml
backup_agent = "claude-code"          # Repo-level fallback
review_backup_agent = "gemini"        # Workflow-specific override
```

When a workflow needs a backup agent, roborev resolves it in this order:

1. Repo-level workflow-specific backup (e.g. `review_backup_agent` in
    `.roborev.toml`)
1. Repo-level generic `backup_agent`
1. Global workflow-specific backup (e.g. `review_backup_agent` in `config.toml`)
1. Global `default_backup_agent`

If a backup agent is found and installed, roborev uses that agent instead. If no
backup is configured or the backup agent isn't installed, the job fails
normally. roborev does not choose unrelated installed agents from the built-in
agent list for workflow-configured reviews or fixes.

Backup models follow the agent selected at the corresponding configuration
layer. Repo-level workflow-specific and generic backup models pair with the
fully resolved repo backup agent. A global workflow-specific backup model pairs
with the workflow backup agent resolved from global configuration, and
`default_backup_model` pairs only with `default_backup_agent`.

This pairing is enforced for ACP backups because ACP agents validate model names
against their advertised model list. If a more-specific backup setting selects
an ACP agent but the inherited model belongs to a different backup agent,
roborev skips the mismatched model and keeps the selected agent's
`[acp.<name>].model`. Explicitly paired backup models and non-ACP backup
behavior are unchanged.

### Agent Command Overrides

If an agent binary is installed under a non-standard name or path, use a `*_cmd`
setting to tell roborev where to find it:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
claude_code_cmd = "/opt/bin/claude"
codex_cmd = "codex-nightly"
gemini_cmd = "gemini"                 # Pin legacy Gemini CLI instead of auto-preferring agy
cursor_cmd = "/usr/local/bin/agent"
opencode_cmd = "/usr/local/bin/opencode-wrapper"
pi_cmd = "~/bin/pi"
grok_cmd = "/opt/bin/grok"
```

| Option | Default command |
|--------|----------------|
| `claude_code_cmd` | `claude` |
| `codex_cmd` | `codex` |
| `gemini_cmd` | auto (`agy`, then `gemini`) |
| `cursor_cmd` | `agent` |
| `opencode_cmd` | `opencode` |
| `pi_cmd` | `pi` |
| `grok_cmd` | `grok` |

These overrides affect both agent execution and availability detection. Without
them, roborev only checks for the default command name when deciding whether an
agent is installed. Gemini is the exception: when `gemini_cmd` is unset, roborev
auto-prefers `agy` before the legacy `gemini` command; set
`gemini_cmd = "gemini"` to pin the legacy CLI, for example when using explicit
Gemini model overrides.

A custom `cursor_cmd` must forward `--version` or `-v` to Cursor and produce
non-empty version output that does not identify as Grok. Wrappers that ignore
version flags, hang, or print nothing are treated as unavailable (fail-closed
identity probe), so a Grok-only `agent` alias cannot be selected as Cursor.

### Agent Name Validation

Unknown agent names in configuration files and CLI flags are now validated and
rejected early. If you specify an agent name that roborev doesn't recognize,
you'll get a clear error message at startup or command invocation instead of a
confusing failure later.

### Excluded Branches

Skip automatic reviews on work-in-progress branches:

```toml
excluded_branches = ["wip", "scratch", "experiment"]
excluded_branch_patterns = ["worktree-agent-*", "release/*"]
```

`excluded_branches` compares exact branch names. `excluded_branch_patterns` uses
whole-name [`path.Match`](https://pkg.go.dev/path#Match) globs. For example,
`worktree-agent-*` matches `worktree-agent-fix-123`. The `*` wildcard does not
cross a slash, so `release/*` matches `release/1.2` but not `release/team/1.2`.
Malformed patterns are treated as non-matches, and matching continues with the
remaining patterns.

Branch patterns apply only to automatic post-commit reviews. Reviews triggered
manually with `roborev review` still work on matching branches. Exact exclusions
keep their existing automatic review behavior.

### Excluded Commit Patterns

Skip reviews for commits whose messages contain specific substrings
(case-insensitive matching):

```toml
excluded_commit_patterns = ["[skip review]", "wip:", "fixup!"]
```

When reviewing a range, the range is skipped only if every commit in the range
matches. Manually triggered reviews with `roborev review` are not affected.

### Exclude Patterns

Common lockfiles and generated files are excluded from review diffs by default:
`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lockb`, `bun.lock`,
`uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `pdm.lock`, `go.sum`, `Cargo.lock`,
`Gemfile.lock`, `composer.lock`, `packages.lock.json`, `pubspec.lock`,
`mix.lock`, `Package.resolved`, `Podfile.lock`, `flake.lock`, and the `.beads/`,
`.gocache/`, and `.cache/` directories.

To exclude additional files, use `exclude_patterns` in either global or per-repo
config:

```toml
# .roborev.toml
exclude_patterns = ["generated.go", "*.pb.go", "vendor/"]
```

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
exclude_patterns = ["*.min.js", "dist/"]
```

Patterns can be filenames, directory names (with trailing `/`), or glob patterns
(including `**`). Both global and repo-level patterns are merged. User patterns
are appended to the built-in exclusion list.

!!! note

    Security reviews (`--type security`) skip repo-level exclude patterns entirely.
    A compromised `.roborev.toml` on a branch cannot hide files from security
    review. Global-level patterns still apply.

### Prompt Size Budget

The `max_prompt_size` (per repo) and `default_max_prompt_size` (global) settings
control the inline prompt budget in bytes before file handoff. The per-repo
value takes precedence over the global default. The default is 204,800 bytes
(200 KiB).

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
default_max_prompt_size = 300000   # 300 KB global default

# .roborev.toml
max_prompt_size = 500000           # 500 KB for this repo only
```

Ordinary reviews, dirty reviews, stored task prompts, and synthesis use the same
prompt preparation. roborev first assembles the complete prompt, including its
discussion, instructions, and review content. If it exceeds the configured
inline budget, roborev writes that complete string to a repo-local `prompt.md`
snapshot and asks the agent to read it in full. The budget selects transport; it
does not reject the task or discard context. Synthesis uses the same
read-capable agent invocation as ordinary reviews for both inline prompts and
prompt files. Its instructions restrict the task to combining the supplied
reviews, with tools used only to read referenced prompt or review-input files.

Prior same-base range reviews may also use a separate XML snapshot. Those files
and the complete prompt snapshot stay available until the invocation finishes,
then are cleaned up together. Agents' actual context-window errors still follow
the normal failure or failover path.

By default, snapshots are written to `.roborev/` under the repo root so the
agent sandbox does not need broader filesystem access. Override the location
with `snapshot_dir` in `.roborev.toml`:

```toml
# .roborev.toml
snapshot_dir = ".cache/roborev"
```

`snapshot_dir` must be a relative path under the repo root, must not be inside
`.git`, and must not contain control characters. `roborev init` ensures the
configured directory is ignored in `.gitignore`; snapshot creation also writes a
local `.git/info/exclude` fallback for existing checkouts whose ignore setup is
stale.

### Post-Commit Review Mode

By default, the post-commit hook reviews the single commit at HEAD. Set
`post_commit_review = "branch"` to review all commits since the branch diverged
from the base branch instead:

```toml
post_commit_review = "branch"
```

When set to `"branch"`, each commit triggers a `merge-base..HEAD` range review
covering the entire branch. On the base branch itself (e.g. `main`), detached
HEAD, or any error, the hook falls back to a single-commit review.

This setting only affects the post-commit hook. `roborev review` is not changed
by this option.

### Post-commit review batching

By default, the post-commit hook queues a review after every commit. To combine
several small commits into one automatic review, set a repository-local batch
size:

```toml
post_commit_batch_size = 5
```

The hook returns without contacting the daemon until the configured number of
commits has accumulated. It then queues one review over the accumulated range.
Values below `2`, including the default of `1`, disable batching.

Batch checkpoints are stored per branch in shared Git metadata, so linked
worktrees use the same pending range. The pre-push hook attempts to queue a
partial batch before its branch is pushed. It does not block the push if
queueing fails, and the checkpoint remains pending for a later hook. After a
rebase or amend, the next review covers everything since the last commit still
shared with the old history. Run `roborev init` after upgrading roborev to
install or update the pre-push hook.

When `post_commit_review = "branch"` is also set, the batch size controls when a
review is queued, while the review still covers the entire branch.

### Auto-Close Passing Reviews

By default, all reviews remain open in the queue until you explicitly close
them. Set `auto_close_passing_reviews = true` to automatically close reviews
that pass. A review whose findings all fall below `review_min_severity` passes
and is closed too; the findings stay readable in the closed review:

```toml
auto_close_passing_reviews = true
```

When enabled, reviews with a passing verdict are closed immediately after the
verdict is parsed. Failed reviews remain open for attention. This is useful if
you only want to focus on reviews that found issues.

The option works in both global config (`~/.roborev/config.toml`) and per-repo
config (`.roborev.toml`). Per-repo settings override the global value.

## Isolated Review Checkouts

By default, the daemon runs local review agents in the checkout that queued the
review. If a worktree manager checks for processes inside a linked worktree, it
may refuse to remove that worktree until the review finishes.

Enable `isolate_reviews` to run agents in temporary detached checkouts owned by
the daemon:

```bash
roborev config set isolate_reviews true --global
```

You can also set `isolate_reviews = true` in `.roborev.toml`. A repository value
overrides the global setting, including an explicit `false`. The default is
`false`, and changes apply to subsequent job attempts.

- Commit reviews, range reviews, and their panel synthesis jobs use a checkout
    at the reviewed commit (the head of the range). This includes post-commit
    reviews.
- Agents and temporary prompt files use the daemon-owned checkout. The original
    linked worktree can be removed while the agent runs. The detached checkout
    still shares the repository's Git objects; keep that object store available.
- The job keeps its original repository, branch, and worktree identity. Internal
    checkout paths are not substituted into events or filtering.
- Review configuration still comes from the source checkout. If that checkout is
    already gone when an attempt starts, the daemon uses the main repository's
    configuration. Prefer a global setting or configuration available in the
    main repository when using disposable worktrees.
- Each attempt gets its own checkout, removed after success, failure, or
    cancellation. Daemon startup cleans up checkouts left by an interrupted
    daemon.

Queued jobs and retries still need the repository path recorded on the job. For
a worktree linked to a main checkout, keep that main checkout available. For a
worktree created from a bare repository, roborev registers the linked checkout
itself as the repository path. Removing it lets the current agent finish, but
prevents queued jobs and retries from starting, even if the bare repository
remains available.

Isolated agents see committed files, without the source checkout's local edits,
untracked files, or ignored build artifacts. Creating the checkout adds disk use
and setup time; submodules and Git LFS files are prepared as for CI reviews.
Checkout failures follow the normal job retry policy without falling back to
running the agent in the source worktree.

Dirty reviews and their synthesis jobs continue to use the source checkout.
Tasks, compact jobs, and background fixes keep their existing behavior. CI
reviews already use detached checkouts and do not depend on this setting.

## Global Configuration

Create `~/.roborev/config.toml` to set system-wide defaults.

```toml
default_agent = "codex"
default_model = "gpt-5.5"  # Default LLM
default_backup_model = "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"  # Model paired with default_backup_agent
server_addr = "127.0.0.1:7373"
max_workers = 4
job_timeout_minutes = 30          # Per-job timeout in minutes
hook_timeout_seconds = 30         # Post-commit hook request timeout (0 = platform default: 3, 30 on Windows)
agent_quota_cooldown = "30m"      # Maximum quota cooldown after agent limits
review_guidelines = "Global review instructions for every repo."
hide_closed_by_default = true     # Start TUI with closed/failed/canceled hidden
mouse_enabled = true              # Enable mouse interactions in the TUI
tab_width = 4                     # Tab expansion width for code blocks in TUI (default: 2)
column_borders = true             # Show separators between TUI columns

[tui]
filter_repo = false               # Show all repos on startup (default: current repo)
filter_branch = false             # Show all branches on startup (default: current branch)
```

!!! note

    The previous config key `hide_addressed_by_default` is still read as a fallback.
    If you have it set and `hide_closed_by_default` is not present, the old value is
    used automatically. No action is required, but new configs should use the new
    name.

### Review Search Embeddings

Lexical review-history search needs no configuration and never calls an
embedding provider. Semantic and hybrid search use an optional global-only
`[search.embeddings]` block in `~/.roborev/config.toml`:

```toml
[search.embeddings]
base_url = "https://api.voyageai.com/v1"
model = "voyage-4-large"
dims = 1024
api_key = { env = "VOYAGE_API_KEY" }
input_type_mode = "retrieval"
batch_size = 32
timeout_seconds = 30
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `base_url` | - | OpenAI-compatible endpoint base; Roborev appends `/embeddings` unless the path already ends with it. Must not contain credentials, a query, or a fragment |
| `model` | - | Provider model identifier |
| `dims` | - | Required positive response dimension |
| `api_key` | - | The bearer key itself as a string, or `{ env = "NAME" }` or `{ file = "PATH" }` |
| `input_type_mode` | `none` | `none` omits `input_type`; `retrieval` sends `document` for indexing and `query` for search |
| `fingerprint_salt` | - | Optional operator-controlled generation invalidator |
| `batch_size` | `32` | Maximum inputs per provider request |
| `model_context_tokens` | - | Most tokens one input can hold; set together with `max_batch_tokens` to batch by tokens |
| `max_batch_tokens` | - | Provider's aggregate input-token cap per request; set together with `model_context_tokens` |
| `timeout_seconds` | `30` | Provider request timeout in seconds |
| `trust_private_network` | `false` | Allow plain HTTP to a private-network endpoint (a private, link-local, or carrier-grade NAT address, or a host name) |

These are the standard embedding keys shared by Kenn tools, so the same block
works in any of them. `base_url`, `model`, and `dims` must be configured
together.

When upgrading to 0.70.0, replace `api_key_env = "NAME"` with
`api_key = { env = "NAME" }`. See
[embedding credentials](/docs/search/#embedding-credentials) for setup and
troubleshooting.

`api_key` is the key itself as a string, or a table naming its source:
`{ env = "NAME" }` reads an environment variable and `{ file = "PATH" }` reads a
private file (a leading `~/` is your home directory). Leave it unset for an
endpoint that needs no key. A key file must be a regular file you own with mode
`0600`; symlinks are refused. If the configured source is missing, empty,
unreadable, or insecure, the daemon starts normally with semantic search
disabled and makes no embedding requests. Reviews and lexical search continue
without startup warnings.

The Search section of `roborev daemon status` and `GET /api/health` reports
`credential` (`missing`, `rejected`, or `ok`), `credential_source` (never the
key), and a readable `credential_reason` when unavailable. `auto` search
includes the reason when falling back to lexical; explicit semantic/hybrid modes
fail with it. Provider rejection (401/403) clears after a successful embedding
request. A service-started daemon may not inherit shell variables; prefer
`api_key = { file = "..." }` for that setup. Embedding settings require a daemon
restart and cannot be overridden in `.roborev.toml`.

For Voyage, this release supports the default 1,024-dimensional output from
`voyage-4-large`. Roborev validates `dims` but does not send Voyage's
provider-specific `output_dimension` field, so non-default Voyage dimensions are
outside this release.

Enabling hosted embeddings sends rendered review and response prose to the
provider. That prose may quote code, paths, URLs, or logs. Raw prompts, diffs,
patches, command lines, job logs, token data, repository paths, and remote
identities are excluded from embedding input. See
[Review History Search](/docs/search/) for the full privacy boundary, backfill
behavior, health fields, and sidecar recovery.

### Hot-Reload

The daemon automatically watches `~/.roborev/config.toml` for changes. Most
settings take effect immediately without restarting the daemon.

**Settings that require daemon restart:** `server_addr`, `max_workers`, the
`[web]` section, the `[mcp]` section, the `[sync]` section, and the `[search]`
section.

### Browser Application

Roborev serves its embedded browser application from a listener separate from
the loopback CLI API. Local browser access works without additional
configuration: `roborev ui` starts the daemon when needed and opens the
runtime-advertised browser origin.

To expose that listener through an HTTPS reverse proxy, keep the daemon-side
listener on loopback and configure an exact public origin. Roborev can either
authenticate browsers with its own token or delegate admission to the proxy and
private network.

For Roborev token authentication, generate a compatible base64url value with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '='
```

Paste that command's output as `auth_token`:

```toml
[web]
enabled = true
listen = "127.0.0.1:7374"
public_origin = "https://reviews.example.com"
base_path = "/reviews"
auth_token_file = "/etc/roborev/web-auth-token"
```

`public_origin` must be an exact scheme-and-authority origin with no path. Set
`base_path` separately when the proxy mounts the browser application below a URL
prefix; it must start with `/`, have no trailing slash, query, fragment, percent
escape, backslash, control character, surrounding whitespace, or path traversal.
The token file must contain exactly one base64url-encoded 32-byte token,
optionally followed by one terminal newline. It is mutually exclusive with
`auth_token` and is read when the daemon starts, so the token bytes do not need
to be stored in the configuration file.

If global `auth_key` is set, you can omit both browser token settings and use
that key at login, including through an HTTPS `public_origin`. A configured
browser token takes precedence over the shared key for browser login.

To use the reverse proxy or private network as the admission boundary instead,
configure proxy authentication and omit both token settings:

```toml
[web]
enabled = true
listen = "127.0.0.1:7374"
public_origin = "https://reviews.example.com"
base_path = "/reviews"
auth_mode = "proxy"
```

Proxy mode is explicit and requires an exact HTTPS `public_origin`. Roborev
automatically creates its normal process-local browser session after validating
the public Host, exact Origin, same-origin browser fetch metadata, and
forwarding request shape. Proxy sessions keep the restricted remote-user
capabilities and all mutation requests still require the tab-scoped CSRF
credential. Unknown auth modes and proxy configurations containing either token
setting fail before the listener starts.

When the global `auth_key` is also enabled, configure the proxy to add
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` to backend requests for `/api/ui/session` and its
subpaths (including `base_path`, if configured). Those endpoints reject missing
or incorrect keys. Keep the injected key in the proxy's protected configuration;
the browser uses its normal session credentials afterward.

The proxy must preserve the public `Host`, set conventional forwarding headers,
and avoid buffering `/api/stream/events` and streamed `/api/job/output`
responses. The public origin must match the browser origin exactly and must use
HTTPS for remote access. Roborev rejects non-loopback browser listener addresses
so credentials are never sent over a plaintext network hop. The CLI API remains
private on its original listener.

The browser session cookie uses `/` when `base_path` is empty and
`base_path + "/"` when a prefix is configured. That path scope reduces
incidental cookie transmission, but it is not an authorization boundary: scripts
on the same origin can still make requests below the prefix. `base_path`
provides routing only. Token deployments should use a dedicated origin. Proxy
deployments must trust every application served from the configured origin; use
a dedicated origin when that is not true.

In token mode, the browser exchanges the daemon token for an HTTP-only cookie
and tab-scoped credentials. The token is entered after the public shell opens
and is never retained by the application. Every daemon restart requires the
token again, including from the daemon host. Invalid logins trigger a
process-wide exponential cooldown. A valid token bypasses that cooldown and
resets the failure count immediately. In proxy mode, successful same-origin
bootstrap creates those credentials automatically; a stale cookie after restart
is replaced without displaying the token prompt.

The shell itself is public so a cross-site deep link can load while the session
cookie uses `SameSite=Strict`. Its subsequent same-origin bootstrap request
receives the cookie and creates credentials stored only for that tab. Disable
the listener with `web.enabled = false`; in that mode, `roborev ui` reports that
browser access needs to be configured instead of opening a dead URL.

See [Browser UI](/docs/web-ui/) for the exact installed-user workflow, a
Tailscale Serve recipe, browser-session behavior, and the analytics metric
definitions.

### MCP Server

The daemon can serve a [Model Context Protocol](/docs/integrations/mcp/)
endpoint at `/mcp` on its API listener. It supports review reads, comments,
closure, snoozing, and hook fix completion. It cannot start reviews. It is off
by default:

```toml
[mcp]
enabled = true
```

Enabling it requires a daemon restart. The stdio transport, `roborev mcp serve`,
needs no configuration.

### Data Directory

All roborev data is stored in `~/.roborev/` by default:

```
~/.roborev/
├── config.toml       # Global configuration
├── daemon.json       # Runtime state (port, PID)
├── post-commit.log   # JSONL log of post-commit hook invocations
├── reviews.db        # SQLite database
└── logs/jobs/        # Persistent job output logs
```

Override with the `ROBOREV_DATA_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
export ROBOREV_DATA_DIR=/custom/path
```

### Unix Domain Socket

On Unix systems, the daemon can listen on a Unix domain socket instead of TCP
loopback. This provides filesystem-level access control: the socket is created
with `0600` permissions and its parent directory with `0700`, so only the owning
user can connect.

The default TCP daemon also tries to expose this private socket as an alternate
endpoint. Clients can fall back to it when a sandbox blocks TCP loopback. This
alternate is best-effort: if the socket cannot be created, the daemon warns and
continues serving TCP. Its path is namespaced by the configured data directory
and advertised through daemon runtime metadata, so isolated daemons do not
replace one another's fallback. An explicit `server_addr = "unix://"`
configuration remains socket-only.

To enable Unix domain sockets, set `server_addr` to `unix://`:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
server_addr = "unix://"
```

With `unix://` (no path), the socket is created at
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/roborev/daemon.sock` when `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is set and points
to an existing absolute directory. Otherwise, the socket is placed under the
platform temp directory (e.g. `/tmp` on Linux, `/var/folders/.../T` on macOS) at
`{tempdir}/roborev-{UID}/daemon.sock`, where `{UID}` is your numeric user ID. To
use a specific path:

```toml
server_addr = "unix:///var/run/roborev/daemon.sock"
```

The CLI flag works the same way:

```bash
roborev --server unix:// tui
roborev daemon run --addr "unix:///custom/path.sock"
```

Stale socket files from previous daemon runs are cleaned up automatically on
startup. The socket is removed on graceful shutdown.

!!! note

    Unix domain sockets are not supported on Windows. Socket path length is limited
    to 104 bytes on macOS and 108 bytes on Linux.

### Persistent Daemon

The daemon starts automatically when you run `roborev init` or any command that
needs it, and stays running in the background. This is sufficient for most
users. If you want the daemon to survive reboots, restart on failure, or be
managed alongside other system services, set up a system service.

Daemon startup waits up to two minutes for database migrations and readiness.
While waiting, the CLI reports elapsed time, the startup log path, and the
latest log message from the current attempt every 15 seconds. These notices go
to stderr. If startup times out, the error includes the log path and latest
message; the child process may still be initializing. Check that log before
retrying.

!!! warning "Use `--no-daemon` with system services"

    If you manage the daemon with systemd or launchd, use `roborev init --no-daemon`
    when registering repos. Otherwise, `roborev init` auto-starts a background
    daemon that conflicts with the service-managed one.

**macOS (launchd):**

```bash
# Resolve paths. Homebrew prefix differs between Intel and Apple Silicon
ROBOREV_BIN="$(command -v roborev)"
BREW_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix 2>/dev/null || echo /usr/local)"

mkdir -p ~/Library/Logs/roborev
cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.roborev.daemon.plist << EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

    <string>${HOME}/Library/Logs/roborev/daemon.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.roborev.daemon.plist
```

The heredoc expands `${ROBOREV_BIN}`, `${BREW_PREFIX}`, and `${HOME}` at
generation time so the plist contains absolute paths. Launchd does not expand
`~` or environment variables in plist values.

**Linux (systemd):**

roborev ships with `roborev.service` and `roborev.socket` unit files in its
`packaging/systemd/` directory. If your package manager installed the unit
files, enable the user-level service:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now roborev
```

For on-demand startup via socket activation, enable the socket unit instead. The
daemon starts automatically when a client connects and uses `Type=notify` to
signal readiness back to systemd:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now roborev.socket
```

If the unit files are not available (e.g., you used `go install` or the install
script), create a service unit manually. This covers the always-on service mode;
socket activation requires the bundled unit files.

```bash
# Resolve the actual binary path for ExecStart
ROBOREV_BIN="$(command -v roborev)"

mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/roborev.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=roborev daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=${ROBOREV_BIN} daemon run
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOF

systemctl --user enable --now roborev
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ROBOREV_DATA_DIR` | Override default data directory (`~/.roborev`) |
| `ROBOREV_COLOR_MODE` | Color theme: `auto` (default), `dark`, `light`, `none`. See [Color Mode](#color-mode) |
| `ROBOREV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | Set to `0` to disable anonymous telemetry |
| `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | Generic telemetry opt-out. Set to `0` to disable telemetry |
| `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | Example credential source for Voyage when named by `search.embeddings.api_key = { env = "VOYAGE_API_KEY" }` |
| `NO_COLOR` | Set to any value to disable all color output ([no-color.org](https://no-color.org)) |

### Telemetry

roborev sends limited anonymous telemetry when the daemon starts and once every
24 hours while it remains running. Events are `daemon_started` and
`daemon_active`, with repo count, review count, whether sync is enabled, whether
CI is enabled, whether auto design review is enabled, roborev version, OS,
architecture, and an anonymous install ID stored in the local database.

The web UI also asks the daemon to report an anonymous `app_opened` event when
it loads and on the first window focus of each later UTC day. `roborev tui` asks
each time it starts. Commands that work through the daemon, such as
`roborev review`, `roborev list` and `roborev show`, ask once their first daemon
request succeeds, and they never start a daemon to do so. Git hook, agent hook,
MCP and daemon management commands never report it. Commands run by the bundled
agent skills pass `--from-skill` and are not counted; an agent that runs roborev
outside a bundled skill, or drops the flag, still counts. The daemon sends it
with the same install ID, version, OS and architecture plus `surface`, which is
`web`, `tui` or `cli` and nothing else. It sends at most one `app_opened` per
surface per UTC day, so repeated loads, tabs, launches and commands on the same
day count once. It forgets which surfaces it sent on restart. The browser, the
TUI and the CLI never contact PostHog. The same environment variables turn it
off; the daemon reads them, and so do the `roborev tui` and CLI processes.

Each event carries `install_age_hours`, the whole hours since the install ID was
created, so short-lived installs such as test sandboxes can be filtered out.
Installs created before roborev recorded that time send events without it.

Telemetry does not include repo names, paths, remotes, prompts, review output,
provider tokens, usernames, or IP geolocation. Disable it with either
environment variable:

```bash
ROBOREV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0 roborev daemon run
TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0 roborev daemon run
ROBOREV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0 roborev tui
ROBOREV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0 roborev review
```

Telemetry is disabled in Go test processes.

### Color Mode

The TUI automatically adapts to light and dark terminals by default. Use
`ROBOREV_COLOR_MODE` to override the auto-detection:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `auto` | Detect terminal background color (default) |
| `dark` | Force dark color palette |
| `light` | Force light color palette |
| `none` | Strip all colors (equivalent to `NO_COLOR=1`) |

```bash
ROBOREV_COLOR_MODE=dark roborev tui
```

`NO_COLOR` takes precedence over `ROBOREV_COLOR_MODE` at all layers. When
`NO_COLOR` is set, all ANSI color sequences are stripped regardless of
`ROBOREV_COLOR_MODE`.

In Windows Terminal, standalone commands such as `log`, `fix`, and `refine`
attempt background detection once, provided standard input and output are
console handles and no input is queued. They wait up to five seconds, matching
termenv's Unix query timeout, then keep the dark palette if detection fails. The
query leaves unrelated input untouched. A terminal reply arriving after
detection stops can remain queued for the next reader; forcing `dark` or `light`
avoids the query. The TUI instead receives background replies through its active
input loop and does not wait for detection during startup.

### Model Selection

The `default_model` setting specifies which model agents should use. The format
varies by agent:

```toml
# OpenAI models (Codex, Copilot)
default_model = "gpt-5.5"

# Anthropic models (Claude Code)
default_model = "claude-opus-4-8"

# OpenCode (provider/model format)
default_model = "anthropic/claude-opus-4-8"
```

### Cost Usage Endpoint

By default, roborev looks up token usage and cost estimates through the local
`agentsview` CLI. It prefers `session usage --no-sync` to include archived
subagent usage without synchronizing source transcripts. Run AgentsView's
watcher or synchronize separately to keep the archive current. Older CLIs remain
supported: roborev retries without `--no-sync` if the flag is unknown, or falls
back to `token-use` if `session usage` is unavailable. These fallback commands
may synchronize sources.

You can route lookup through an HTTP endpoint instead:

```toml
[cost]
endpoint = "https://usage.example.test/api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/usage"
timeout = "2s"
```

`endpoint` must include `{session_id}`, which roborev URL-escapes and replaces
with the agent session ID. If `endpoint` is empty, roborev uses the `agentsview`
CLI path. `timeout` defaults to `10s`; invalid, zero, or negative values also
fall back to `10s`.

Usage indexing can lag behind job completion. The daemon retries fresh misses
and periodically revisits terminal jobs from the past week that still lack a
recorded price. The missing price in SQLite is the durable retry state, so
reconciliation resumes after daemon restarts. For rows without a stored session
ID, the daemon recovers the ID and token counts from the per-job JSONL log
before retrying the provider. Provider failures do not change the completed job
result. Deleted sessions and sessions reused by multiple started jobs can remain
unpriced; jobs older than the one-week scan window are reachable with
`roborev backfill-tokens`.

The endpoint should return JSON compatible with
`agentsview session usage --format json`:

```json
{
  "session_id": "session-123",
  "agent": "codex",
  "project": "myrepo",
  "total_output_tokens": 28800,
  "peak_context_tokens": 118000,
  "has_token_data": true,
  "cost_usd": 0.42,
  "has_cost": true
}
```

`has_token_data` and `has_cost` are required booleans. When `has_token_data` is
true, token counts are required. A `404` response is treated as no usage data
for that session.

When `has_cost` is true, the cost must arrive in one of two shapes. Either
`cost_usd` as a float, or the integer envelope agentsview adopted in v0.39.0:

```json
{
  "total_output_tokens": 4762,
  "peak_context_tokens": 70092,
  "has_token_data": true,
  "cost": { "microdollars": 131767 },
  "has_cost": true,
  "cost_source": "computed"
}
```

roborev accepts either and prefers the `cost` envelope when both are present.
When using the envelope, omit `cost_usd` rather than sending it as `null` — the
published schema types it as a plain number. roborev itself tolerates an
explicit `null` and treats it as absent, but that leniency is deliberate
defensiveness, not part of the contract.

A session priced at exactly zero must send an explicit `0` (or `0`
microdollars); absent is not the same as free. Flagging `has_cost` with neither
field is a schema error.

### Agentic Mode

Enable agentic mode globally (allows agents to edit files and run commands):

```toml
allow_unsafe_agents = true
```

!!! warning

    This makes all review operations potentially write to your codebase. Use with
    caution. It's generally safer to enable agentic mode per-job with `--agentic`.

### Advanced Section

The `[advanced]` section controls opt-in features that are not part of the
default workflow.

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
[advanced]
tasks_enabled = true   # Enable background tasks in the TUI
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `tasks_enabled` | bool | false | Enable the TUI background tasks workflow (fix jobs, patch application, rebasing) |

When enabled, the TUI exposes the `F` (fix) and `T` (tasks) shortcuts for
launching fix jobs and managing patches. See
[Background Tasks](/docs/advanced/background-tasks/) for the full reference.

### Codex Review Options

The `[agent.codex]` section controls Codex-specific behavior for review jobs.
Both options default to `true` so Codex reviews start from a clean state without
skill instructions or user-level Codex config. Fix jobs are not affected.

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
[agent.codex]
disable_review_skills = true       # Suppress Codex skill instructions on review jobs
ignore_review_user_config = true   # Pass --ignore-user-config to Codex review jobs
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `disable_review_skills` | bool | true | Run Codex review jobs with `skills.include_instructions=false` so model-visible skill instructions are stripped from the prompt |
| `ignore_review_user_config` | bool | true | Pass `--ignore-user-config` to Codex review jobs so user-level Codex config is not loaded |

Set either to `false` to restore the prior behavior if you rely on Codex skill
instructions or user-level Codex config during reviews.

#### Custom Codex Config (Model Providers)

`ignore_review_user_config` stops Codex review jobs from loading your
`~/.codex/config.toml`, which also means a custom `model_provider` and its
`[model_providers.*]` block defined there are not applied. To inject specific
Codex options without loading your full user config, define an
`[agent.codex.config]` table. Every key under it is passed to Codex as a
`-c key=value` override on **every** Codex job (review, fix, refine, analyze),
and these overrides apply even when `--ignore-user-config` is in effect.

The table mirrors Codex's own `config.toml`, so you can declare a custom
provider and select it:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
[agent.codex]
ignore_review_user_config = true   # safe to leave enabled

[agent.codex.config]
model_provider = "my-custom"

[agent.codex.config.model_providers.my-custom]
name = "My Provider"
base_url = "https://api.example.com/v1"
env_key = "MY_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
```

roborev flattens that into `-c model_provider="my-custom"`,
`-c model_providers.my-custom.base_url="https://api.example.com/v1"`, and so on,
one override per leaf key. Values keep their TOML type: strings stay quoted,
numbers and booleans stay bare, and arrays stay arrays. roborev's own review
controls (skill suppression, sandbox mode, reasoning effort) are applied after
your overrides, so they take precedence if a key collides.

#### Windows Sandbox

On native Windows, `--ignore-user-config` also drops the `[windows]` sandbox
selection from your Codex config. Without a native sandbox implementation, Codex
can reject even read-only shell commands with `blocked by policy`. For sandboxed
reviews that ignore user config, roborev passes `-c windows.sandbox="elevated"`
by default, alongside the read-only policy.

This uses Codex's
[recommended Windows sandbox](https://developers.openai.com/codex/windows).
Complete its setup in Codex before running reviews. If your machine requires the
`unelevated` implementation, set it explicitly in roborev:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
[agent.codex.config.windows]
sandbox = "unelevated"
```

This explicit choice takes precedence over roborev's Windows default. When
`ignore_review_user_config = false`, Codex uses its own configuration instead.
roborev does not add the Windows default on other platforms or when the review
bypasses the sandbox.

### Grok Sandbox Profile

The `[agent.grok]` section sets the Grok sandbox profile for non-agentic reviews
and classification:

```toml
[agent.grok]
sandbox = "workspace"
```

Accepted values are `read-only`, `workspace`, `off`, or the name of a custom
profile in `~/.grok/sandbox.toml`. When `sandbox` is unset, roborev uses
`read-only`. If Grok refuses to start that profile, roborev logs a warning and
retries once under `workspace`. See
[Grok sandbox profile](/docs/agents/#sandbox-profile).

### Pi Classifier Options

Pi can be used as the auto design-review classifier because roborev runs Pi with
a JSON schema output extension. The default extension source is
`npm:@nqbao/pi-json-schema@0.1.1`.

Override the extension source under `[agent.pi]` if you vendor or mirror the
extension:

```toml
[agent.pi]
jsonschemaextension = "/opt/roborev/pi-json-schema/index.ts"
```

Install the default extension in Pi so classifier setup is visible to `pi list`
and so locked-down environments do not need to fetch it at runtime:

```bash
pi install npm:@nqbao/pi-json-schema
```

Additional Pi CLI arguments can be prepended to every Pi invocation with
`launch_args`. Each array entry is passed as one argument without shell parsing.
Roborev appends its managed arguments afterward so its workflow and safety
settings retain precedence for well-formed duplicate options.

```toml
[agent.pi]
launch_args = [
  "--extension",
  "npm:@example/pi-provider",
]
```

This is useful when a model provider is registered by an extension. Classifier
jobs retain `--no-extensions`, but Pi still loads extensions named explicitly
with `--extension`. The same launch arguments are also passed to normal reviews
and agentic Pi runs.

`launch_args` is an advanced raw-argument escape hatch, not a validation or
security boundary. Parser-control tokens such as standalone `--`, early-exit
flags, and options missing required values are unsupported and may prevent Pi
from running the managed invocation. Roborev cannot validate every argument
because Pi extensions may define their own flags and value requirements.

## Hooks

Run shell commands when reviews complete or fail. See the
[Review Hooks guide](/docs/guides/hooks) for full details.

```toml
# In config.toml or .roborev.toml
[[hooks]]
event = "review.failed"          # or "review.completed", "review.*"
command = "notify-send 'Review failed for {repo_name}'"

[[hooks]]
event = "review.failed"
type = "beads"   # Built-in: creates a bd issue automatically

[[hooks]]
event = "review.*"
branches = ["main", "release/*"]
type = "kata"    # Built-in: creates Kata issues for failures/findings
```

### Hook Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `event` | string | Event pattern to match, such as `review.completed`, `review.failed`, or `review.*` |
| `branches` | array | Optional branch allowlist using `path.Match` globs. Empty means all branches |
| `command` | string | Shell command with `{var}` template interpolation |
| `type` | string | Built-in hook type (`beads`, `kata`, `webhook`), or omit for custom command |
| `url` | string | Webhook destination URL (required when `type = "webhook"`) |
| `project` | string | Kata project override for `type = "kata"` |
| `labels` | array | Extra Kata labels for `type = "kata"`; `roborev` is always added |
| `priority` | int | Kata issue priority for `type = "kata"` |

Template variables: `{job_id}`, `{repo}`, `{repo_name}`, `{sha}`, `{agent}`,
`{verdict}`, `{findings}`, `{error}`

## Auto Design Review

Off by default. When enabled, roborev decides per commit whether to dispatch a
`--type design` review on top of the normal code review. The router uses cheap
heuristics first (path globs, diff size, file count, commit-subject regexes) and
falls back to a JSON-schema-constrained classifier for ambiguous cases. With
`enabled = true`, the post-commit, `roborev review`, range, and dirty paths all
consult the router, as does the CI poller when `design` is not already in the
configured panel or review matrix. When the router decides not to run, a skipped
row is recorded with a short reason and rendered dimmed in the TUI; PR synthesis
includes a one-line `Auto-design-review skipped: <reason>` section.

By default, the TUI queue hides the auto-design-router's classifier jobs
(`job_type = classify`) and skipped design rows (`status = skipped`, scoped to
`source = auto_design`) so per-commit routing decisions do not crowd out review
rows. Decisions are still recorded and counted on the daemon status endpoint.
Press `s` in the TUI to toggle visibility for the current session, or set
`show_classify_jobs = true` in `~/.roborev/config.toml` to make them visible
globally; per-repo `.roborev.toml` can override with a nullable
`show_classify_jobs` field (omit to inherit). When viewing a hidden classifier
or skipped row, press `l` to see the classifier verdict and `skip_reason`
rendered above the (typically empty) log.

### Enabling

Turn it on globally in `~/.roborev/config.toml`:

```toml
[auto_design_review]
enabled = true
```

To run the router only for automatic post-commit hook reviews, use
`hook_enabled` instead:

```toml
[auto_design_review]
hook_enabled = true
```

`hook_enabled = true` does not affect manual `roborev review`, dirty/range
reviews, or CI. Use `enabled = true` when those entry points should consult the
router too.

A per-repo `[auto_design_review]` block in `.roborev.toml` overrides the global
values. The per-repo `enabled` and `hook_enabled` fields are tri-state: omitting
a field inherits the global setting, `false` explicitly opts a repo out of a
globally-enabled default, and `true` opts a repo in when the global default is
off.

```toml
# .roborev.toml
[auto_design_review]
enabled = false   # opt this repo out of a globally-enabled router
hook_enabled = true  # still allow post-commit hook routing for this repo
```

### Heuristics

The router checks rules in fixed order: trigger paths, large diff, large file
count, trigger message, then skip rules (trivial diff, all-files-skip, skip
message). The first match wins; ambiguous commits go to the classifier.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | false | Enable auto-design routing for post-commit hooks, manual reviews, dirty/range reviews, and CI |
| `hook_enabled` | bool | false | Enable auto-design routing only for post-commit hook reviews |
| `min_diff_lines` | int | 10 | Diffs below this changed-line count are skipped automatically |
| `large_diff_lines` | int | 500 | Diffs at or above this line count trigger a design review automatically |
| `large_file_count` | int | 10 | Commits touching at least this many files trigger automatically |
| `trigger_paths` | array | see below | Doublestar globs; any changed file matching triggers a design review |
| `skip_paths` | array | see below | Doublestar globs; if every changed file matches, the commit is skipped |
| `trigger_message_patterns` | array | see below | Regexes over the commit subject; a match triggers a design review |
| `skip_message_patterns` | array | see below | Regexes over the commit subject; a match skips the design review |
| `classifier_timeout_seconds` | int | 60 | Per-classify-job timeout |
| `classifier_max_prompt_size` | int | 20480 | Cap on classifier prompt size in bytes |

Default `trigger_paths`:

```
**/migrations/**
**/schema/**
**/*.sql
docs/superpowers/specs/**
docs/design/**
docs/plans/**
**/*-design.md
**/*-plan.md
```

Default `skip_paths`:

```
**/*.md
**/*_test.go
**/*.spec.*
**/testdata/**
```

Default `trigger_message_patterns`:

```
\b(refactor|redesign|rewrite|architect|breaking)\b
```

Default `skip_message_patterns`:

```
^(docs|test|style|chore)(\(.+\))?:
```

List fields replace defaults wholesale. Setting an empty list (e.g.
`trigger_paths = []`) disables that family of heuristics for the repo. Unset
list fields inherit the next layer's value.

Invalid globs and uncompilable regexes fail validation at startup so config
typos surface loudly instead of silently suppressing every dispatch.

### Classifier

When heuristics are inconclusive, the router enqueues a `classify` job that runs
the configured classifier agent against an embedded JSON schema. The agent
returns a yes/no decision plus a short reason, and the router promotes the row
to a design-review job or marks it skipped accordingly.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `classify_agent` | string | `claude-code` | Agent for the routing classifier. Must implement structured-output (`SchemaAgent`) capability |
| `classify_model` | string | agent default | Model for the classifier agent |
| `classify_reasoning` | string | `fast` | Legacy or exact value from [Reasoning Levels](#reasoning-levels) |
| `classify_backup_agent` | string | - | Fallback classifier agent on quota exhaustion or failure |
| `classify_backup_model` | string | - | Fallback classifier model |

Currently `claude-code` (via `--json-schema`), `grok` (via headless
`--json-schema` with fail-closed tool denial and validated `structuredOutput`
only), and `pi` (via the configured JSON schema extension) implement the
structured-output capability. Other agents are rejected at config-resolve time
with a list of valid choices.

These keys live at the top level of the config file (not inside
`[auto_design_review]`), since they describe the classifier agent the same way
`review_agent` and `fix_agent` describe their workflows:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
classify_agent = "claude-code"
classify_model = "claude-opus-4-8"
classify_reasoning = "fast"

[auto_design_review]
enabled = true
```

### CI integration

When the CI poller picks up a PR, it runs the auto design-review router on the
head SHA when `design` is not already in the configured panel or review matrix.
If heuristic inputs (diff, changed files, commit message) fail to assemble, the
commit degrades to the classifier instead of being silently skipped.

The daemon `/api/status` endpoint exposes a `SkippedJobs` aggregate count, plus
an `auto_design` subobject with five per-outcome counters (`triggered`,
`skipped_heuristic`, `triggered_classifier`, `skipped_classifier`, `errored`)
when the feature is enabled anywhere. The subobject is omitted from the JSON
when the feature is disabled across all repos.

## Reasoning Levels

Reasoning levels control how deeply the AI analyzes code. The exact values
`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` request the same-named native effort
from agents that support it. An unsupported exact tier is left unset rather than
collapsed into a different tier. Prefer exact values for new CLI invocations and
configuration. The legacy presets remain accepted for compatibility.

Use this table when moving from legacy presets to exact tiers. These are the
closest matches in intent, not universal aliases: legacy presets retain their
agent-specific behavior.

| Legacy preset | Preferred exact tier | Difference to consider |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| `fast` | `low` | Kilo's legacy preset uses `minimal`; exact `low` requests `low` |
| `standard` | `medium` | Legacy `standard` usually leaves the agent's default unchanged; exact `medium` requests `medium` |
| `thorough` | `high` | Current reasoning-capable agents map the legacy preset to `high` |
| `maximum` | `xhigh` or `max` | The legacy ceiling varies by agent and Codex model; choose the exact tier deliberately |

The legacy values keep their established per-agent behavior:

| Legacy value | Codex | Claude | Grok | Droid | Kilo | Pi |
|--------------|-------|--------|------|-------|------|----|
| `fast` | `low` | `low` | `low` | `low` | `minimal` | `low` |
| `standard` | default | default | default | default | default | `medium` |
| `thorough` | `high` | `high` | `high` | `high` | `high` | `high` |
| `maximum` | GPT-5.6 `sol`/`terra`/`luna`: `max`; otherwise `xhigh` | `max` | `max` | `high` | `high` | `high` |

Native support is agent-specific. Codex, Claude, Grok, and Pi accept all five
exact values. Droid accepts `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Kilo passes exact
values through as model variants, so availability depends on the selected
provider and model. Agents without a reasoning flag ignore the level while
workflow-specific agent and model routing still uses its exact name.

For Codex, the legacy `maximum` preset requests literal `max` only when the
selected model is explicitly `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, or `gpt-5.6-luna`.
Older, default, and unknown models keep the compatible `xhigh` mapping. Use the
exact `xhigh` value to request `xhigh` on every Codex model, including GPT-5.6.

Set per-command with `--reasoning`, or per-repo in `.roborev.toml`:

```bash
roborev review --reasoning low    # Exact native low effort
roborev refine --reasoning high   # Exact native high effort
roborev review --reasoning xhigh  # Exact native xhigh effort
```

The legacy `--reasoning fast`, `standard`, `thorough`, and `maximum` values and
the `--fast` shorthand continue to work. Avoid mixing legacy and exact suffixes
between matching agent and model configuration keys.

## Authentication

### Claude Code

Claude Code uses your Claude subscription by default. roborev deliberately
ignores `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment to avoid unexpected API
charges.

To use Anthropic API credits instead of your subscription:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
anthropic_api_key = "sk-ant-..."
```

roborev automatically sets `CLAUDE_NO_SOUND=1` when running Claude agents to
suppress notification and completion sounds.

To route Claude Code through a local or remote proxy (Ollama, LiteLLM, LM
Studio, etc.) instead of Anthropic's API, use the `<model>@<base_url>` model
spec. See
[Routing Claude Code to a Proxy](/docs/agents/#routing-claude-code-to-a-proxy).

### Other Agents

- **Codex**: Uses authentication from `codex auth`
- **Gemini**: Uses authentication from Gemini CLI
- **Copilot**: Uses GitHub Copilot subscription via GitHub CLI
- **OpenCode**: Uses API keys configured in its own settings, set model to use
    in config TOML files

### Environment Variable Expansion

Sensitive values can reference environment variables:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
anthropic_api_key = "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
```

This keeps secrets out of config files while still allowing roborev to use them.
